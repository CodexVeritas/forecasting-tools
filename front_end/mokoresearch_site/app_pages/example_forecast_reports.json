            "background_info": "Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group, have escalated dramatically. Recently, Hezbollah launched over 200 rockets into Israel in retaliation for the killing of one of its senior commanders by an Israeli strike. This attack represents one of the largest confrontations in the ongoing conflict along the Lebanon-Israel border, with significant military actions taken by both sides. Israel responded with strikes on various towns in southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah's military structures.\n\nThe conflict, which intensified following the outbreak of war in Gaza, has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border and resulted in numerous casualties. Israel considers Hezbollah its most direct threat, estimating the group possesses an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided ones. The international community, including the U.S. and France, is actively working to prevent these skirmishes from escalating into an all-out war that could impact the broader region. Despite diplomatic efforts, Israeli officials have indicated that they might decide to go to war in Lebanon if a diplomatic solution cannot be achieved.",

From the credible sources, it must be clear that the troops are acting deliberately on orders of the Government of Israel and without permission of the currently recognized Government of Lebanon or the assent of the United Nations.\n\nThe announcements must describe events that take place (at least in part) between the launch of this question and October 1, 2024.\n\nFor the purpose of this question, Lebanese territory is determined by the 2000 Blue Line.",

Adjusted up due to high readiness and willingness to engage militarily, Hezbollah's aggressive stance, and significant hostilities in southern Lebanon. Adjusted down due to ongoing diplomatic efforts and recent escalations not resulting in a ground invasion.\n- *Forecaster 1*: [Predicted 3.25%] Chose a base rate of 1.25% based on the historical frequency of Israeli ground troop invasions into Lebanon. Adjusted up due to significant escalation and aggressive statements from both sides. Adjusted down due to ongoing diplomatic efforts and the relatively low historical frequency of invasions.\n- *Forecaster 2*: [Predicted 6.0%] Chose a base rate of 6% based on all major ground invasions by Israel into Lebanon over the past 50 years. Adjusted up due to high readiness for conflict and U.S. preparation for potential conflict. Adjusted down due to diplomatic efforts and recent escalations not resulting in a ground invasion.\n- *Forecaster 3*: [Predicted 10.0%] Chose a base rate of 6% based on multiple instances of Israeli ground troop invasions into Lebanon. Adjusted up due to significant escalation, readiness for conflict, and U.S. preparation. Adjusted down due to diplomatic efforts and recent escalations not resulting in a ground invasion.\n- *Forecaster 4*: [Predicted 14.0%] Chose a base rate of 6% based on all major ground invasions into Lebanon by Israel over the past 50 years. Adjusted up due to high readiness for conflict and significant hostilities. Adjusted down due to diplomatic efforts and recent escalations not resulting in a full-scale invasion.\n\n## Summary of the Research\nThe research report focuses on the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah as of late August 2024. Hezbollah's leader has declared a new phase of conflict, with significant military actions and threats of major retaliation. Israel has responded with strikes on southern Lebanon, and both sides have engaged in tit-for-tat attacks. The situation is further complicated by broader regional tensions, with Iranian and Hezbollah leaders vowing retaliation for Israeli airstrikes that killed civilians in the Golan Heights. Israeli and U.S. officials anticipate imminent attacks from Hezbollah and Iran, raising fears of a wider war.\n\nRecent statements by Israeli officials indicate a high level of readiness to engage militarily if provoked, despite a preference to avoid conflict. Hezbollah's aggressive stance and threats of major retaliation increase the likelihood of escalation. The current situation on the ground in southern Lebanon is marked by significant hostilities and civilian impact, with increased use of advanced weaponry. The United States is preparing for a potential conflict involving Hezbollah, indicating a strategic alignment with Israel. However, international diplomatic efforts are ongoing to de-escalate the conflict, though their success remains uncertain.\n\n## Possible Base Rates\n- Israel has conducted three major ground invasions into Lebanon over the past 50 years: 1978, 1982, and 2006. This results in a base rate of 3/50 or 6% [S2.Q0]\n- Full-scale invasions following escalations with Hezbollah have occurred twice in the past 50 years: 1982 and 2006. This results in a base rate of 2/50 or 4% [S2.Q1]\n- Israel has a history of responding to significant provocations with military action, with a notable success rate of threats leading to invasions. This suggests a base rate of around 10% [S2.Q3]\n- The historical frequency of Israeli ground troop invasions in response to significant civilian displacement and casualties is approximately 6% [S2.Q6]\n\n## Pros\n- Recent statements by Israeli officials indicate a high level of readiness and willingness to engage militarily if provoked [S1.Q1]\n- Hezbollah's aggressive stance and threats of major retaliation increase the likelihood of escalation [S1.Q2]\n- The current situation on the ground in southern Lebanon is marked by significant hostilities and civilian impact, which historically has led to Israeli invasions [S1.Q3]\n- The U.S. is preparing for a potential conflict involving Hezbollah, indicating a strategic alignment with Israel [S1.Q5]\n- Israel has recently integrated new technologies and advanced systems into its military operations, enhancing its readiness for conflict [S1.Q6]\n\n## Cons\n- International diplomatic efforts are ongoing to de-escalate the conflict, though their success remains uncertain [S1.Q7]\n- Historical frequency of full-scale invasions following escalations with Hezbollah is relatively low [S2.Q1]\n- Recent escalations have not yet resulted in a ground invasion, indicating a possible shift in Israel's immediate military strategy [S2.Q5]\n- The U.S. and France are actively working to prevent the conflict from escalating into an all-out war [S1.Q5]\n\n## Weaknesses and possible improvements\n- *Over-reliance on historical base rates*: The chosen base rates may not fully account for the unique current geopolitical context. \"Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 6% because it aggregates all major ground invasions by Israel into Lebanon over the past 50 years, providing a broader historical context.\"\n- *Insufficient consideration of diplomatic efforts*: The impact of ongoing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict may be underestimated. \"International diplomatic efforts are ongoing to de-escalate the conflict, though their success remains uncertain.\"\n- *Potential bias towards recent events*: The analysis may be overly influenced by recent escalations and statements, without sufficient weighting of long-term trends. \"Recent statements by Israeli officials indicate a high level of readiness and willingness to engage militarily if provoked.\"\n\n\n# S1: BACKGROUND QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n## Q0: What is the current state of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah as of late August 2024?\nAnswer:\nAs of late August 2024, the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has significantly escalated.

But we are prepared to protect our civilians, our soldiers and our sovereignty\" \\[[2](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/9/israel-threatens-to-return-lebanon-to-stone-age-in-any-war-with-hezbollah#:~:text=The%20threat%20issued%20by%20Israeli%20Defence%20Minister%20Yoav%20Gallant%20on%20Tuesday%20comes%20after%20weeks%20of%20repeated%20skirmishes%20with%20the%20armed%20Iran-backed%20group%20on%20the%20border%20area%20between%20the%20two%20countries)\\]. This statement came after weeks of repeated skirmishes with Hezbollah along the border area between Israel and Lebanon. Gallant's comments underscore Israel's readiness to engage militarily if provoked, despite a preference to avoid conflict.\n\nAdditionally, Israel has accused Hezbollah of increased provocations, such as the erection of two tents in the disputed border area and new tensions around the divided border town of Ghajar \\[[4](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/9/israel-threatens-to-return-lebanon-to-stone-age-in-any-war-with-hezbollah#:~:text=Israel%20recently%20accused%20Hezbollah%20of%20increased%20provocations%2C%20such%20as%20the%20erection%20of%20two%20tents%20in%20the%20disputed%20border%20area)\\].

The Biden administration has been discussing with the parties the parameters of a longer-term agreement to increase stability along the border. One key principle supported by the U.S. is to have the Lebanese Armed Forces become the sole border force on Lebanon\u2019s side, thereby pushing Hezbollah forces away from the border with Israel. However, Israeli officials have sent mixed messages about the distance Hezbollah fighters would need to move north of the border to allow Israeli civilians to return to their communities in northern Israel \\[[2](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-lebanon-hezbollah-talks.html#:~:text=The%20Lebanese%20foreign%20minister%2C%20prime%20minister%20and%20speaker%20of%20Parliament%20have%20been%20acting%20as%20intermediaries%20for%20Hezbollah%2C%20according%20to%20a%20senior%20Lebanese%20official)\\]\\[[3](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-lebanon-hezbollah-talks.html#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20does%20not%20negotiate%20directly%20with%20Hezbollah%2C%20which%20it%20has%20designated%20a%20terrorist%20organization)\\].\n\nDespite these efforts, the likelihood of success remains uncertain. The U.S. does not negotiate directly with Hezbollah, which complicates the process, and there has been little progress so far. The situation is further strained by ongoing military actions and the lack of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, which indirectly affects the Israel-Hezbollah dynamic \\[[13](https://www.axios.com/2023/12/18/israel-us-hezbollah-lebanon-border#:~:text=Israel%20has%20evacuated%20tens%20of%20thousands%20of%20civilians%20from%20Israeli%20villages%20and%20towns%20close%20to%20the%20border%20as%20a%20precaution%20for%20a%20possible%20attack%20by%20Hezbollah%27s%20elite%20Radwan%20forces%20like%20the%20one%20Hamas%20conducted%20on%20Oct)\\].

Key instances include:\n\n1. **1978 Invasion**: In response to a commando attack by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) that resulted in numerous Israeli casualties, Israel invaded Lebanon on the night of March 14-15, 1978. Israeli forces occupied the entire southern part of Lebanon except for the city of Tyre and its surrounding area \\[[1](https://unifil.unmissions.org/unifil-background#:~:text=In%20the%20early%201970s%2C%20tension%20along%20the%20Israel-Lebanon%20border%20increased%2C%20especially%20after%20the%20relocation%20of%20Palestinian%20armed%20elements%20from%20Jordan%20to%20Lebanon)\\]\\[[15](https://unifil.unmissions.org/unifil-background#:~:text=On%2011%20March%201978%2C%20a%20commando%20attack%20in%20Israel%20resulted%20in%20many%20dead%20and%20wounded%20among%20the%20Israeli%20population%3B%20the%20Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization%20%28PLO%29%20claimed%20responsibility%20for%20that%20raid)\\].\n\n2. **1982 Invasion**: Known as \"Operation Peace for Galilee,\" Israel launched a major invasion in 1982 aimed at destroying the PLO's military and political infrastructure in Lebanon.

This historical context is crucial for forecasting potential future invasions.\n## Q1: How often have escalations between Israel and Hezbollah led to full-scale invasions in the past?\nAnswer:\nEscalations between Israel and Hezbollah have led to full-scale invasions in the past, but such occurrences are relatively rare. The most notable instance was the 1982 invasion, known as \"Operation Peace for Galilee,\" where Israel invaded Lebanon with the stated aim of destroying the Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) military and political apparatus. This invasion led to significant military engagement and the eventual creation of Hezbollah \\[[2](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/17/beyond-hezbollah-the-history-of-tensions-between-lebanon-and-israel#:~:text=%201982%3A%20On%20June%206%2C%201982%2C%20Israel%20invaded%20Lebanon%20under%20the%20pretence%20of%20stopping%20PLO%20raids%20across%20its%20border)\\]\\[[11](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/iopt0807/9.htm#:~:text=In%201982%2C%20Israel%20launched%20a%20major%20invasion%20it%20called%20%E2%80%9COperation%20Peace%20for%20Galilee%E2%80%9D%20for%20the%20stated%20purpose%20of%20destroying%20the%20Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization%E2%80%99s%20military%20and%20political%20apparatus%20in%20Lebanon)\\]. \n\nAnother significant conflict was the 2006 Lebanon War, also known as the July War or the 33-Day War, which began after Hezbollah launched rockets at Israeli border towns and ambushed an Israeli military patrol. This conflict resulted in a large-scale military response from Israel, but it did not escalate to a full-scale invasion similar to that of 1982 \\[[9](https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/cobban-33-day-war/#:~:text=Neither%20of%20these%20protagonists%20craves%20violence%20for%20its%20own%20sake)\\]. \n\nOverall, while there have been multiple escalations and conflicts, full-scale invasions have been less frequent, with the 1982 invasion being the most prominent example.\n## Q2: How frequently have international diplomatic efforts successfully prevented a major conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in the past?\nAnswer:\nInternational diplomatic efforts have had some success in preventing major conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in the past. One notable instance is the 1996 Israeli\u2013Lebanese Ceasefire Understanding, also known as the Grapes of Wrath Understandings. This informal agreement, brokered by the United States, ended the military conflict between Israel and Hezbollah by stipulating that both sides would cease cross-border attacks on civilian targets and refrain from launching attacks from civilian villages. A Monitoring Committee, including representatives from the US, France, Syria, Israel, and Lebanon, was established to oversee the implementation of the agreement \\[[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-Lebanese_Ceasefire_Understanding#:~:text=%20%20The%20Israeli%E2%80%93Lebanese%20Ceasefire%20Understanding%20%28also%20known%20as%20The%20Grapes%20of%20Wrath%20Understandings%20and%20the%20April%20Understanding%29%20was%20an%20informal%20written%20agreement%20between%20Israel%20and%20Hezbollah%2C%20reached%20through%20the%20diplomatic%20efforts%20of%20the%20US%2C%20which%20ended%20the%201996%20military%20conflict%20between%20the%20two%20sides)\\]\\[[12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-Lebanese_Ceasefire_Understanding#:~:text=It%20was%20announced%20at%2018%3A00%20on%20April%2026%2C%201996)\\].\n\nAnother significant example is the unilateral withdrawal of Israeli forces from Southern Lebanon in 2000, which was carried out by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Although this withdrawal was not the result of a direct diplomatic agreement with Hezbollah, it was influenced by broader diplomatic considerations, including failed peace talks with Syria. This move was seen by many as a victory for Hezbollah and has contributed to a relatively calm situation, despite ongoing tensions and occasional violations of ceasefire agreements \\[[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_17_Agreement#:~:text=In%202000%2C%20Israel%20withdrew%20from%20its%20foothold%20in%20South%20Lebanon)\\]\\[[10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lebanon_conflict_(1985%E2%80%932000)#:~:text=%5D%20in%20Israel%20that%20the%20Security%20Zone%20was%20not%20permanent%2C%20but%20the%20Israeli%20government%20hoped%20that%20a%20withdrawal%20could%20be%20carried%20out%20in%20the%20context%20of%20a%20wider%20agreement%20with%20Syria%20and%2C%20by%20extension%2C%20Lebanon)\\].\n\nThese examples indicate that while diplomatic efforts have not always led to lasting peace, they have been effective in de-escalating specific conflicts and preventing immediate large-scale warfare.\n## Q3: What is the historical success rate of Israeli military threats leading to actual invasions?\nAnswer:\nThe historical success rate of Israeli military threats leading to actual invasions can be analyzed through several key instances. Israel has a history of using military threats and limited force strategies, which have sometimes escalated into full-blown wars. For example, the 1956 Suez Crisis, the 1967 Six-Day War, and the 1982 Lebanon War all followed periods of heightened military threats and tensions \\[[11](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-studies-an-anthology-israeli-military-strategy#:~:text=This%20has%20increased%20the%20strategic%20emphasis%20on%20preemptive%20strikes%2C%20as%20illustrated%20in%20the%201956%20and%201967%20general%20wars%2C%20the%201982%20and%202006%20Lebanon%20conflicts%20and%20the%20attacks%20against%20nuclear%20facilities%20in%20Iraq%20%281981%29%20and%20Syria%20%282008%29)\\]. Additionally, Israel's strategy often involves preemptive strikes to enhance deterrence capabilities, as seen in the 1981 attack on Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor and the 2007 strike on Syria's nuclear facility \\[[11](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-studies-an-anthology-israeli-military-strategy#:~:text=This%20has%20increased%20the%20strategic%20emphasis%20on%20preemptive%20strikes%2C%20as%20illustrated%20in%20the%201956%20and%201967%20general%20wars%2C%20the%201982%20and%202006%20Lebanon%20conflicts%20and%20the%20attacks%20against%20nuclear%20facilities%20in%20Iraq%20%281981%29%20and%20Syria%20%282008%29)\\].\n\nA quantitative analysis of Israeli military actions from 1949 to 2003 indicates that limited force strategies were occasionally used to foster escalation, and in some cases, mismanagement of these engagements led to larger conflicts \\[[8](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636410701547782#:~:text=The%20study%20is%20based%20on%20a%20historical%20survey%20of%20these%20policies%20and%20on%20quantitative%20analysis%20of%20a%20dataset%20of%20the%20use%20of%20limited%20force%20by%20Israel%20over%20the%201949%E2%80%932003%20period)\\]. This suggests that while not all military threats lead to invasions, there is a significant historical precedent for threats escalating into military action.\n\nIn summary, Israel's military threats have a notable historical success rate of leading to invasions, particularly when preemptive strikes and deterrence strategies are involved. This pattern is evident in several major conflicts and is supported by quantitative analysis of past military engagements \\[[8](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636410701547782#:~:text=The%20study%20is%20based%20on%20a%20historical%20survey%20of%20these%20policies%20and%20on%20quantitative%20analysis%20of%20a%20dataset%20of%20the%20use%20of%20limited%20force%20by%20Israel%20over%20the%201949%E2%80%932003%20period)\\]\\[[11](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-studies-an-anthology-israeli-military-strategy#:~:text=This%20has%20increased%20the%20strategic%20emphasis%20on%20preemptive%20strikes%2C%20as%20illustrated%20in%20the%201956%20and%201967%20general%20wars%2C%20the%201982%20and%202006%20Lebanon%20conflicts%20and%20the%20attacks%20against%20nuclear%20facilities%20in%20Iraq%20%281981%29%20and%20Syria%20%282008%29)\\].\n## Q4: How often have major regional conflicts involving Israel been initiated after significant provocations or escalations by Hezbollah?\nAnswer:\nMajor regional conflicts involving Israel have often been initiated after significant provocations or escalations by Hezbollah. Notably, the 2006 Lebanon War was precipitated by a Hezbollah cross-border raid, which led to a full-scale conflict between Hezbollah paramilitary forces and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) \\[[14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War#:~:text=The%20principal%20parties%20were%20Hezbollah%20paramilitary%20forces%20and%20the%20Israel%20Defense%20Forces%20%28IDF%29)\\]. This conflict saw unprecedented Iranian military support to Hezbollah, highlighting the significant role of external provocations in escalating tensions.\n\nAdditionally, the formation of Hezbollah itself was a direct response to Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which aimed to stop PLO raids but extended as far as Beirut, leading to the eventual departure of the PLO from Lebanon \\[[2](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/17/beyond-hezbollah-the-history-of-tensions-between-lebanon-and-israel#:~:text=%201982%3A%20On%20June%206%2C%201982%2C%20Israel%20invaded%20Lebanon%20under%20the%20pretence%20of%20stopping%20PLO%20raids%20across%20its%20border)\\].

However, more recent escalations, such as those in 2023, have not yet resulted in a similar ground invasion, indicating a possible shift in Israel's immediate military strategy.\n## Q6: What is the historical frequency of Israeli ground troop invasions into Lebanon when significant civilian displacement and casualties have occurred?\nAnswer:\nThe historical frequency of Israeli ground troop invasions into Lebanon in response to significant civilian displacement and casualties can be summarized through key events:\n\n1. **1978 Invasion**: Following a commando attack by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) that resulted in many Israeli civilian casualties, Israel invaded Lebanon on March 14-15, 1978, occupying the southern part of the country except for the city of Tyre \\[[1](https://unifil.unmissions.org/unifil-background#:~:text=In%20the%20early%201970s%2C%20tension%20along%20the%20Israel-Lebanon%20border%20increased%2C%20especially%20after%20the%20relocation%20of%20Palestinian%20armed%20elements%20from%20Jordan%20to%20Lebanon)\\]\\[[15](https://unifil.unmissions.org/unifil-background#:~:text=On%2011%20March%201978%2C%20a%20commando%20attack%20in%20Israel%20resulted%20in%20many%20dead%20and%20wounded%20among%20the%20Israeli%20population%3B%20the%20Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization%20%28PLO%29%20claimed%20responsibility%20for%20that%20raid)\\].\n\n2. **1982 Invasion**: In response to attacks from Palestinian militants based in Lebanon, Israel launched \"Operation Peace for Galilee\" in 1982. This invasion led to extensive civilian casualties, particularly through aerial bombardments and the siege of Beirut. The United Nations called for an immediate withdrawal, but Israel continued to occupy large parts of Lebanon \\[[4](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/iopt0807/9.htm#:~:text=Israel%E2%80%99s%20aerial%20bombardments%20killed%20thousands%20of%20civilians%20as%20its%20forces%20laid%20siege%20to%20Beirut)\\]\\[[7](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/iopt0807/9.htm#:~:text=In%201982%2C%20Israel%20launched%20a%20major%20invasion%20it%20called%20%E2%80%9COperation%20Peace%20for%20Galilee%E2%80%9D%20for%20the%20stated%20purpose%20of%20destroying%20the%20Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization%E2%80%99s%20military%20and%20political%20apparatus%20in%20Lebanon)\\]\\[[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_Southern_Lebanon#:~:text=The%20Israeli%20occupation%20of%20Southern%20Lebanon%20formally%20began%20in%201985%20and%20ended%20in%202000%20as%20part%20of%20the%20South%20Lebanon%20conflict)\\].\n\n3. **2006 Conflict**: The 2006 Lebanon War, triggered by Hezbollah's cross-border raid and rocket attacks, saw significant Israeli ground operations in Lebanon. This conflict resulted in substantial civilian displacement and casualties, with Israel conducting extensive military operations in southern Lebanon \\[[4](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/iopt0807/9.htm#:~:text=Israel%E2%80%99s%20aerial%20bombardments%20killed%20thousands%20of%20civilians%20as%20its%20forces%20laid%20siege%20to%20Beirut)\\]\\[[11](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/iopt0807/9.htm#:~:text=The%20United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20issued%20resolutions%20calling%20for%20a%20total%2C%20immediate%20and%20unconditional%20withdrawal%20of%20troops%20from%20Lebanon)\\].\n\nThese invasions were typically in response to significant provocations involving civilian casualties and displacement, often linked to militant activities against Israel. The pattern suggests that Israel has historically responded to such provocations with ground invasions, particularly when the attacks resulted in substantial civilian harm.\n## Q7: How often have increased military capabilities or technological advancements led to Israeli ground troop invasions in the past?\nAnswer:\nIn the context of the question \"Will Israel invade Lebanon before October 1, 2024?\", historical data on Israeli ground troop invasions in relation to increased military capabilities or technological advancements is limited. However, there are a few notable instances where advancements or strategic military decisions led to ground invasions:\n\n1. **Operation Hiram (1948)**: This operation was conducted during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and aimed at capturing the Upper Galilee region. It was marked by heavy fighting and resulted in significant territorial gains for Israel. The operation was led by General Moshe Carmel and involved coordinated military efforts, suggesting that strategic planning and military capability played a role in its execution \\[[11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Hiram#:~:text=%20Operation%20Hiram%20was%20a%20military%20operation%20conducted%20by%20the%20Israel%20Defense%20Forces%20%28IDF%29%20during%20the%201948%20Arab-Israeli%20War)\\].\n\n2. **Battle of Suez (1973)**: During the Yom Kippur War, Israel decided to capture the city of Suez on October 23, 1973, assuming it would be poorly defended. This decision was influenced by the imminent arrival of UN observers and the strategic importance of the city. An armored brigade and an infantry battalion were committed to the task, although the operation faced significant challenges and heavy resistance \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Suez#:~:text=The%20Battle%20of%20Suez%20was%20fought%20on%20October%2024%E2%80%9325%2C%201973%20between%20the%20Israel%20Defense%20Forces%20and%20the%20Egyptian%20Army%20in%20the%20Egyptian%20town%20of%20Suez)\\]\\[[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Suez#:~:text=It%20was%20the%20last%20major%20battle%20of%20the%20Yom%20Kippur%20War%2C%20before%20a%20ceasefire%20took%20effect)\\]\\[[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Suez#:~:text=%20On%20October%2023%2C%20with%20the%20imminent%20arrival%20of%20UN%20observers%20to%20the%20front%2C%20Israel%20decided%20to%20capture%20Suez%2C%20assuming%20it%20would%20be%20poorly%20defended)\\].\n\nThese examples indicate that while increased military capabilities and strategic decisions have led to ground invasions in the past, the outcomes have varied based on the specific context and execution of the operations. The historical frequency of such invasions is not high, and each instance appears to be driven by a combination of strategic necessity and available military resources.\n\n# S3: FORECASTS\n*Median prediction*: 10.0%\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 0\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- Israel has conducted three major ground invasions into Lebanon over the past 50 years: 1978, 1982, and 2006.

Given the high level of readiness and willingness to engage militarily if provoked, I'll adjust up by 5% to 15%. Hezbollah's aggressive stance and threats of major retaliation increase the likelihood of escalation, so I'll adjust up by another 5% to 20%. The significant hostilities and civilian impact in southern Lebanon historically leading to invasions warrant an additional 5% increase to 25%. The U.S. preparing for a potential conflict involving Hezbollah suggests strategic alignment with Israel, so I'll adjust up by 2% to 27%. Israel's recent integration of new technologies and advanced systems into its military operations enhances its readiness, so I'll adjust up by 3% to 30%. However, ongoing international diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict and the relatively low historical frequency of full-scale invasions following escalations with Hezbollah suggest a cautious approach, so I'll adjust down by 5% to 25%. The recent escalations not yet resulting in a ground invasion and the active efforts by the U.S. and France to prevent an all-out war warrant a further 5% decrease to 20%.\n\n*Prediction*: 20.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 1\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- Israel has conducted several ground troop invasions into Lebanon over the past 50 years. Notable instances include the 1978 invasion, the 1982 invasion, and the 2006 Lebanon War. This gives a base rate of 3 significant invasions in 50 years, or 6% per year. Since we are looking at a 2.5-month period, the base rate is approximately 1.25% [Q0]\n- Historical data indicates that significant provocations by Hezbollah have led to major conflicts with Israel, such as the 1982 and 2006 invasions. This suggests a base rate of 2 major conflicts in 50 years, or 4% per year. For a 2.5-month period, this translates to approximately 0.83% [Q4]\n- The historical success rate of Israeli military threats leading to actual invasions is notable, particularly with preemptive strikes.

This base rate is directly relevant to the question and considers the specific context of ground invasions.\n\n*Pros*:\n- The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has significantly escalated, with Hezbollah's leader declaring a new phase of conflict and threatening major retaliation [Q0]\n- Recent statements by Israeli officials indicate a high level of readiness and willingness to engage militarily with Hezbollah if provoked [Q1]\n- Hezbollah has made aggressive statements and shown a high level of readiness for large-scale conflict [Q2]\n- The situation on the ground in southern Lebanon is marked by escalating hostilities and significant civilian impact, which historically has led to Israeli invasions [Q3]\n- The United States is preparing for a potential conflict involving Hezbollah, indicating a strategic alignment with Israel [Q5]\n\n*Cons*: \n- International diplomatic efforts are ongoing to de-escalate the conflict, although their success remains uncertain [Q7]\n- Recent escalations have not yet resulted in a large-scale ground invasion, indicating a possible shift in Israel's immediate military strategy [Q5]\n- The historical frequency of Israeli ground troop invasions is relatively low, with only a few significant instances over the past 50 years [Q0]\n- The base rate of Israeli ground troop invasions following significant civilian displacement and casualties is not high [Q6]\n\n*Reasoning*: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 1.25%. Given the significant escalation in the conflict and aggressive statements from both sides, I'll adjust up by 1% to 2.25%. The high level of readiness and willingness to engage militarily from Israeli officials and Hezbollah's aggressive stance further support an upward adjustment by 1% to 3.25%. The ongoing hostilities and significant civilian impact in southern Lebanon, which historically has led to invasions, justify an additional 1% increase to 4.25%. However, the ongoing diplomatic efforts and the relatively low historical frequency of invasions suggest caution, so I'll adjust down by 0.5% to 3.75%. The lack of recent large-scale ground invasions despite escalations indicates a shift in strategy, leading to a further 0.5% decrease to 3.25%.\n\n*Prediction*: 3.25%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 2\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- Israel has conducted 3 major ground invasions into Lebanon over the past 50 years (1978, 1982, 2006).

This gives a base rate of 2/50 = 0.04 or 4% [Q1]\n- Israel has conducted 2 major ground invasions into Lebanon following significant civilian displacement and casualties (1982, 2006). This gives a base rate of 2/50 = 0.04 or 4% [Q6]\n- Israel has conducted 2 major ground invasions into Lebanon following the establishment of a new phase of conflict declared by Hezbollah (1982, 2006). This gives a base rate of 2/50 = 0.04 or 4% [Q5]\n- 39% of Metaculus questions resolved positively in 2018, which can be used as a general base rate if no better information is available [General Knowledge]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.06\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 6% because it aggregates all major ground invasions by Israel into Lebanon over the past 50 years, providing a broader historical context.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Recent statements by Israeli officials indicate a high level of readiness and willingness to engage militarily with Hezbollah if necessary [Q1]\n- Hezbollah's leader has declared that the conflict with Israel has entered a new phase, threatening major retaliation [Q0]\n- The current situation on the ground in southern Lebanon is marked by escalating hostilities and significant civilian impact [Q3]\n- The United States is preparing for a potential conflict involving Hezbollah in early 2024 [Q5]\n\n*Cons*: \n- International diplomatic efforts are actively working to prevent the conflict from escalating into an all-out war [Q0]\n- Recent diplomatic efforts led by the United States aim to increase stability along the border and prevent a wider conflict [Q7]\n- Israel has not yet launched a large-scale ground invasion despite significant provocations and escalations in the past year [Q5]\n- The historical frequency of Israeli ground invasions following increased military capabilities or technological advancements is low [Q7]\n\n*Reasoning*: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 6%. Recent statements by Israeli officials and Hezbollah's leader, as well as the current situation on the ground, suggest a high level of readiness for conflict, so I'll adjust up by 4% to 10%. The United States preparing for a potential conflict involving Hezbollah also supports an increase, so I'll adjust up by another 2% to 12%. However, international diplomatic efforts and the aim to prevent escalation into an all-out war suggest a decrease, so I'll adjust down by 3% to 9%. The fact that Israel has not yet launched a large-scale ground invasion despite significant provocations and escalations in the past year suggests a further decrease, so I'll adjust down by another 2% to 7%. Lastly, the low historical frequency of invasions following increased military capabilities or technological advancements suggests a final decrease of 1% to 6%.\n\n*Prediction*: 6.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 3\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- Israel has conducted several ground troop invasions into Lebanon over the past 50 years.

This gives a base rate of 3 invasions in 50 years, or 6% [Q6]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.06\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 6% because it aggregates multiple instances of Israeli ground troop invasions into Lebanon in response to significant provocations and escalations.\n\n*Pros*:\n- The current conflict has significantly escalated, with Hezbollah firing thousands of rockets and drones at Israel, leading to the evacuation of tens of thousands of Israeli citizens [Q0]\n- Recent statements by Israeli officials indicate a high level of readiness and willingness to engage militarily with Hezbollah if necessary [Q1]\n- Hezbollah's leader has declared a new phase of conflict, threatening major retaliation and involving all of Israel's borders [Q2]\n- The situation on the ground in southern Lebanon is marked by escalating hostilities and significant civilian impact, with increased use of advanced weaponry [Q3]\n- The United States is preparing for a potential conflict involving Hezbollah in early 2024, indicating a strategic alignment with Israel [Q5]\n\n*Cons*: \n- International diplomatic efforts, particularly by the United States, are ongoing to de-escalate the conflict and increase stability along the border [Q7]\n- Recent escalations, such as those in 2023, have not yet resulted in a ground invasion, indicating a possible shift in Israel's immediate military strategy [Q5]\n- Hezbollah's commitment to its resistance campaign against Israel suggests that tensions are likely to persist, but not necessarily escalate to a full-scale invasion [Q7]\n\n*Reasoning*: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 6%. The current conflict has significantly escalated, with Hezbollah firing thousands of rockets and drones at Israel, leading to the evacuation of tens of thousands of Israeli citizens, so I'll adjust up by 3% to 9%. Recent statements by Israeli officials indicate a high level of readiness and willingness to engage militarily with Hezbollah if necessary, so I'll adjust up by 2% to 11%. Hezbollah's leader has declared a new phase of conflict, threatening major retaliation, so I'll adjust up by 2% to 13%.

The United States is preparing for a potential conflict involving Hezbollah in early 2024, indicating a strategic alignment with Israel, so I'll adjust up by 2% to 17%. However, international diplomatic efforts are ongoing to de-escalate the conflict, so I'll adjust down by 3% to 14%.

Recent escalations have not yet resulted in a full-scale ground invasion, indicating a possible shift in strategy, so I'll adjust down by another 2% to 15%. The likelihood of success for current diplomatic efforts remains uncertain but ongoing, so I'll adjust down by 1% to 14%.",

This mixed sentiment could be crucial for adjusting predictions.\n## Q4: What are the major political endorsements and public statements about Kamala Harris's candidacy?\nAnswer:\nKamala Harris has received several significant endorsements for her candidacy in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. President Joe Biden has publicly endorsed her, stating, \"Today I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year\" \\[[8](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kamalaharris2024#:~:text=%22Today%20I%20want%20to%20offer%20my%20full%20support%20and%20endorsement%20for%20Kamala%20to%20be%20the%20nominee%20of%20our%20party%20this%20year)\\]\\[[11](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/kamalaharris2024#:~:text=%22My%20fellow%20Democrats%2C%20I%20have%20decided%20not%20to%20accept%20the%20nomination%20and%20to%20focus%20all%20my%20energies%20on%20my%20duties%20as%20President%20for%20the%20remainder%20of%20my%20term)\\]. This endorsement is particularly impactful given Biden's current position and influence within the Democratic Party.\n\nAdditionally, other key Democratic figures have also endorsed Harris.

This shift suggests that Harris's campaign strategies and the Democratic Party's consolidation around her candidacy are positively impacting her polling numbers.

During the Democratic Convention, Harris aimed to present herself as ready to be president from Day 1, focusing on her experience and readiness rather than symbolic gestures \\[[1](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/23/opinion/scorecard-night-4-democratic-convention.html#:~:text=It%20was%20as%20if%20the%20campaign%20had%20offloaded%20talk%20of%20symbolism%20to%20other%20speakers%20so%20that%20Harris%20could%20present%20herself%20as%20ready%20to%20be%20president%20on%20Day%201)\\].

Key areas of focus include economic policies, healthcare, and climate change.\n\n1. **Economic Policies**: Harris has proposed significant economic initiatives such as $25,000 in down-payment aid for first-time home buyers and continued support for the child tax credit. She also aims to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, aligning with President Biden's position. Additionally, she has called for legislation to punish companies engaged in price-gouging \\[[5](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/20/harris-cautious-hold-details-campaign#:~:text=The%20Democratic%20Party%27s%20policy%20platform%20originally%20was%20passed%20through%20a%20committee%20on%20July%2016%20%E2%80%94%20before%20Biden%20dropped%20out%20%E2%80%94%20and%20still%20includes%20several%20references%20to%20a%20second%20Biden%20term%20rather%20than%20a%20Harris%20presidency)\\]\\[[11](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/20/harris-cautious-hold-details-campaign#:~:text=They%20largely%20focused%20on%20the%20economy%2C%20as%20Donald%20Trump%20maintains%20a%20polling%20lead%20on%20the%20issue)\\].\n\n2. **Healthcare**: Harris has moderated her stance on healthcare. While she previously supported Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" bill, which would have eliminated private health insurance, she has since walked back on this position. Her current healthcare plan envisions a gradual transition to government-backed health insurance over ten years without completely eliminating private insurance \\[[4](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-policy-positions-president-2024/#:~:text=Joe%20Biden%27s%20campaign%20manager%20at%20the%20time%2C%20Kate%20Bedingfield%2C%20said%20of%20Harris%20that%20she%20had%20a%20%22long%20and%20confusing%20pattern%20of%20equivocating%20about%20%28her%29%20stance%20on%20health%20care%20in%20America)\\]\\[[6](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-policy-positions-president-2024/#:~:text=%22%20During%20a%20primary%20debate%20in%202019%2C%20Harris%20raised%20her%20hand%20when%20moderators%20asked%20candidates%20if%20they%20would%20get%20rid%20of%20private%20health%20insurance)\\].\n\n3. **Climate Change**: Harris has emphasized her commitment to addressing the climate crisis. She played a pivotal role in the Biden administration's significant investment in climate initiatives and aims to ensure clean air, clean water, and affordable, reliable energy for all Americans.

This historical context suggests a challenging path for female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections.\n## Q2: How often have incumbent Presidents or Vice Presidents won re-election compared to their challengers?\nAnswer:\nIn the context of the larger question \"Will Kamala Harris win the US 2024 election?\", it is important to consider historical data on the re-election rates of incumbent Presidents and Vice Presidents. Historically, first-term incumbents have a significant advantage unless there is a recession during or just before the election. Since World War II, incumbents have always won re-election when there was no recession \\[[1](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/us-president-incumbents-tend-to-win-elections-except-during-recessions.html#:~:text=When%20there%20is%20no%20recession%2C%20the%20incumbent%20has%20always%20won%20in%20the%20post-World%20War%20II%20era)\\]\\[[3](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/us-president-incumbents-tend-to-win-elections-except-during-recessions.html#:~:text=First-term%20incumbency%20typically%20provides%20an%20advantage%20%E2%80%94%20unless%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20recession%20during%20or%20just%20before%20the%20election)\\].

Only five Vice Presidents have successfully won the Presidency through an election: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren, Richard Nixon, and George H.W. Bush \\[[3](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/10/21/9574065/vice-presidents-president-history#:~:text=There%20have%20been%2017%20bids%20for%20the%20presidency%20launched%20after%20a%20vice%20presidents%27%20term)\\]\\[[12](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/10/21/9574065/vice-presidents-president-history#:~:text=Five%20vice%20presidents%20tried%20and%20failed%20to%20get%20their%20party%27s%20endorsement)\\]. This indicates that while it is possible, it is not a common occurrence.\n\n2. **Party Endorsement and Primary Strategy**: Securing the party's endorsement is crucial. For instance, Hubert Humphrey, despite being loyal to the Johnson administration, faced significant opposition within his party due to his stance on the Vietnam War. He avoided the primaries and focused on winning delegates at the Democratic National Convention, which ultimately secured his nomination \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey#:~:text=After%20Lyndon%20B)\\]\\[[13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey#:~:text=%20In%20March%201968%2C%20Johnson%20made%20his%20surprise%20announcement%20that%20he%20would%20not%20seek%20reelection%2C%20and%20Humphrey%20launched%20his%20campaign%20for%20the%20presidency)\\]. This highlights the importance of internal party dynamics and strategic delegate acquisition.\n\n3. **Political Continuity and Support**: Vice Presidents who have won the Presidency often benefited from the support of their predecessors or the continuation of popular policies. Martin Van Buren, for example, was hand-picked by outgoing President Andrew Jackson and was a master politician who navigated a tough election successfully \\[[4](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-day-the-senate-picked-a-u-s-vice-president-on-its-own#:~:text=In%20the%201836%20presidential%20election%2C%20Martin%20Van%20Buren%20won%20the%20election%20with%20170%20electoral%20votes%2C%20defeating%20William%20Henry%20Harrison%20and%20three%20other%20candidates)\\]. This suggests that strong backing from the current administration and a clear political strategy can be advantageous.\n\n4. **Electoral Challenges**: Even with party endorsement, winning the general election can be challenging. Humphrey, despite nearly matching Nixon's popular vote tally, lost the electoral vote by a wide margin \\[[13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey#:~:text=%20In%20March%201968%2C%20Johnson%20made%20his%20surprise%20announcement%20that%20he%20would%20not%20seek%20reelection%2C%20and%20Humphrey%20launched%20his%20campaign%20for%20the%20presidency)\\]. This underscores the importance of not just securing the party nomination but also having a robust general election campaign strategy.\n\nIn summary, while Vice Presidents have historically faced significant challenges in winning the Presidency through election, key factors such as securing party endorsement, strategic delegate acquisition, political continuity, and strong general election campaigns have played pivotal roles in their successes.\n## Q4: What role do fundraising amounts play in predicting the success of a Presidential candidate?\nAnswer:\nFundraising amounts play a significant role in predicting the success of a presidential candidate. Historical data indicates that total fundraising is a strong predictor of success in presidential primaries. For instance, each ten-percentage-point increase in a candidate\u2019s share of total party fundraising during a primary election increases the candidate\u2019s likelihood of winning the nomination by 20% \\[[12](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=At%20the%20start%20of%20the%20primary%20season%2C%20before%20ballots%20have%20been%20cast%2C%20winning%20candidates%20typically%20draw%2085%25%20of%20their%20money%20from%20large%20donors%2C%20compared%20with%2065%25%20for%20candidates%20who%20are%20ultimately%20unsuccessful)\\]. This relationship underscores the importance of financial resources in mounting a competitive campaign.\n\nMoreover, the source of the funds also matters. Winning candidates typically draw a higher percentage of their money from large donors compared to unsuccessful candidates. At the start of the primary season, winning candidates usually receive about 85% of their money from large donors, whereas unsuccessful candidates receive around 65% \\[[12](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=At%20the%20start%20of%20the%20primary%20season%2C%20before%20ballots%20have%20been%20cast%2C%20winning%20candidates%20typically%20draw%2085%25%20of%20their%20money%20from%20large%20donors%2C%20compared%20with%2065%25%20for%20candidates%20who%20are%20ultimately%20unsuccessful)\\]. This suggests that not only the amount but also the composition of fundraising can influence electoral outcomes.\n\nIn summary, both the total amount of funds raised and the mix of donor contributions are critical factors in predicting the success of a presidential candidate. This information can be pivotal in adjusting forecasts for Kamala Harris's chances in the 2024 election.\n## Q5: How accurate have polls been in predicting the outcomes of past US Presidential elections?\nAnswer:\nHistorically, pre-election polls have been relatively good indicators of U.S. presidential election outcomes, with an average error of around 2.5 percentage points dating back to 1980 \\[[3](https://www.thecrosstab.com/2017/01/03/history-polling-error-us-uk/#:~:text=Hillary%20Clinton%20bested%20Donald%20Trump%20in%20the%202016%20election%20popular%20vote%20by%20a%20margin%20of%202)\\]\\[[6](https://www.thecrosstab.com/2017/01/03/history-polling-error-us-uk/#:~:text=Historically%2C%20pre-election%20polls%20are%20relatively%20good%20indicators%20of%20election%20outcomes)\\]. However, there have been notable exceptions where polls have missed the mark, particularly in close elections. For instance, Gallup polling missed the outcomes of the 1948, 1976, and 2004 elections, as well as the popular vote in 2000 and the likely-voter numbers in 2012 \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_polling_for_United_States_presidential_elections#:~:text=Gallup%20polling%20has%20often%20been%20accurate%20in%20predicting%20the%20outcome%20of%20presidential%20elections%20and%20the%20margin%20of%20victory%20for%20the%20winner)\\]. \n\nIn the 2016 election, public opinion polls overestimated Hillary Clinton\u2019s win margin by just one percentage point, making it the fourth most accurate in the last 10 U.S. presidential elections \\[[3](https://www.thecrosstab.com/2017/01/03/history-polling-error-us-uk/#:~:text=Hillary%20Clinton%20bested%20Donald%20Trump%20in%20the%202016%20election%20popular%20vote%20by%20a%20margin%20of%202)\\]\\[[6](https://www.thecrosstab.com/2017/01/03/history-polling-error-us-uk/#:~:text=Historically%2C%20pre-election%20polls%20are%20relatively%20good%20indicators%20of%20election%20outcomes)\\]. Despite this, the 2016 polls were criticized for underestimating Trump voters, especially at the state level \\[[13](https://oaj.fupress.net/index.php/qoe/article/view/9529#:~:text=In%20recent%20US%20presidential%20elections%2C%20there%20has%20been%20considerable%20focus%20on%20how%20well%20public%20opinion%20can%20forecast%20the%20outcome%2C%20and%202016%20proved%20no%20exception)\\]. This suggests that while national polls can provide a general sense of the election outcome, they may not always capture the nuances of voter behavior, particularly in closely contested races.\n## Q6: What is the historical impact of strong media engagement on the success of Presidential candidates?\nAnswer:\nThe historical impact of strong media engagement on the success of Presidential candidates is significant but varies depending on the election phase and the media landscape. Research indicates that media coverage can shape public perception and candidate support, particularly during the primaries and caucuses. For instance, data from the 2012 Presidential election demonstrated the substantial influence of media coverage, especially from outlets like Fox News, on candidate support \\[[1](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/02/10/how-media-coverage-shapes-presidential-polling-more-than-we-think/#:~:text=Data%20from%20the%202012%20Presidential%20election%20shows%20the%20enormous%20impact%20that%20media%20coverage%2C%20especially%20on%20Fox%2C%20can%20have%20on%20candidate%20support%20and%20how%20it%E2%80%99s%20likely%20shaping%20the%202016%20race)\\]\\[[10](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/02/10/how-media-coverage-shapes-presidential-polling-more-than-we-think/#:~:text=Pundits%20tell%20us%20all%20the%20time%20that%20media%20coverage%20is%20driving%20the%20current%20Presidential%20primary%2C%20that%20Donald%20Trump%20and%20other%20outsider%20candidates%20are%20only%20doing%20well%20because%20they%20attract%20so%20much%20attention%20from%20the%20press)\\]. This influence is likely due to the media's role in framing candidates and issues, providing voters with more information, and shaping the narrative around campaigns \\[[1](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/02/10/how-media-coverage-shapes-presidential-polling-more-than-we-think/#:~:text=Data%20from%20the%202012%20Presidential%20election%20shows%20the%20enormous%20impact%20that%20media%20coverage%2C%20especially%20on%20Fox%2C%20can%20have%20on%20candidate%20support%20and%20how%20it%E2%80%99s%20likely%20shaping%20the%202016%20race)\\].\n\nHowever, the impact of media engagement during the general election is less pronounced. By the time of the general election, most voters have already formed strong opinions about the candidates, and party identification becomes a dominant factor in voting decisions. For example, in the 2012 election, nearly 70% of voters had decided whom to vote for before September, indicating that media influence is more limited at this stage \\[[12](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12184766/media-boost-donald-trump-coverage#:~:text=However%2C%20as%20Vanderbilt%20political%20scientist%20Larry%20Bartels%E2%80%99s%20research%20suggests%2C%20a%20general%20election%20campaign%20for%20the%20presidency%20is%20probably%20not%20the%20best%20place%20to%20find%20evidence%20of%20media%20influence)\\]. Additionally, the dynamic nature of the media environment, with the rise of cable television and the Internet, has changed how voters consume information, making it more challenging to measure the direct impact of media on election outcomes \\[[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08824090409359978#:~:text=However%2C%20we%20argue%20that%20the%20media%20environment%20is%20dynamic%20%28e)\\]\\[[7](https://journalism.uoregon.edu/news/six-ways-media-influences-elections#:~:text=Recent%20shifts%20in%20the%20media%20landscape%20have%20changed%20how%20the%20press%20interacts%20with%20candidates%2C%20campaigns%20and%20the%20voting%20public)\\].\n\nIn summary, while strong media engagement can significantly influence candidate success during the primaries, its impact diminishes during the general election as voters' preferences become more entrenched.\n\nSources:\n1.

Additionally, a higher share of women (68.4%) than men (65.0%) turned out to vote, which is consistent with past elections \\[[1](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2020-presidential-election-voting-and-registration-tables-now-available.html#:~:text=These%20data%20come%20from%20the%202020%20Current%20Population%20Survey%20Voting%20and%20Registration%20Supplement%20for%20the%20November%202020%20presidential%20election%2C%20which%20surveyed%20the%20civilian%20noninstitutionalized%20population%20in%20the%20United%20States)\\]. Voter turnout also increased with age, educational attainment, and income \\[[5](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2020-presidential-election-voting-and-registration-tables-now-available.html#:~:text=The%20table%20package%20shows%20patterns%20of%20voter%20turnout%20by%20race%2C%20Hispanic%20origin%2C%20age%20and%20other%20characteristics%20such%20as%20educational%20attainment%20and%20family%20income)\\]. Specifically, turnout in the 35-64 age group was 69% in 2020, up from 65% in 2016, and for those 65 and older, it was 74% in 2020, compared to 71% in 2016 \\[[6](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/record-high-turnout-in-2020-general-election.html#:~:text=In%20the%2035-64%20age%20group%2C%20turnout%20was%2069%25%2C%20compared%20to%2065%25%20in%202016)\\].\n\nThese trends suggest that demographic groups that are likely to support Kamala Harris, such as women, Asians, and older voters, have shown increased voter turnout in recent elections. This information could be crucial for forecasting her chances in the 2024 election.\n\n# S3: FORECASTS\n*Median prediction*: 32.0%\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 0\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- Since 1948, 33% of sitting Vice Presidents who ran for President have won the election [Q0]\n- Historically, 39% of Metaculus questions resolved positively in 2018 [General]\n- In U.S. history, only one female candidate from a major party has won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College [Q1]\n- Out of 43 presidents, only 16 won two consecutive elections, indicating a success rate of approximately 37% for incumbents [Q2]\n- Five Vice Presidents have successfully won the Presidency through an election out of 12 attempts, which is approximately 42% [Q3]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.33\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: The most appropriate base rate is 33% because it specifically relates to sitting Vice Presidents running for President, which is directly relevant to Kamala Harris's situation.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Kamala Harris has strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters [Q0]\n- Harris has seen unprecedented fundraising success, raising over $200 million in the first week [Q1]\n- Key Democratic figures, including President Joe Biden, have endorsed her candidacy [Q4]\n- Recent polls show Harris has gained ground and is performing better than before Biden's withdrawal [Q5]\n- Voter turnout among demographic groups that support Harris has increased in recent elections [Q7]\n\n*Cons*: \n- A plurality of Americans believe Donald Trump is more likely to win the Presidential Election [Q0]\n- Harris has faced criticism for limited media engagement and lack of detailed policy plans [Q1]\n- Trump leads Harris by 5 points in a head-to-head matchup according to Rasmussen Reports [Q0]\n- The historical success rate of female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections is low [Q1]\n- Harris has avoided press conferences and interviews, raising questions about her transparency [Q6]\n\n*Reasoning*: Starting with the base rate of 33% for sitting Vice Presidents who ran for President. Adjusting upwards for strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters (+5%), unprecedented fundraising success (+5%), key endorsements (+5%), and recent polling gains (+5%). Adjusting downwards for public perception favoring Trump (-5%), limited media engagement and lack of detailed policy plans (-5%), Rasmussen poll showing Trump leading (-5%), historical challenges for female candidates (-5%), and criticism for avoiding press conferences (-5%).\n\n*Prediction*: 33.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 1\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- In U.S. history, twelve sitting Vice Presidents have run for President while in office. Out of these twelve, four have been elected to the presidency, which translates to a success rate of approximately 33% [Q0.Q0]\n- The historical success rate of female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections is notably low, with no female candidate having won the presidency [Q0.Q1]\n- Out of the 43 men who served as president before the current incumbent, only 16 won two consecutive elections, indicating a success rate of less than half [Q0.Q2]\n- Only five Vice Presidents have successfully won the Presidency through an election: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren, Richard Nixon, and George H.W. Bush [Q0.Q3]\n- 39% of Metaculus questions resolved positively in 2018 [Q0.Q0]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.33\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 33% because it specifically pertains to sitting Vice Presidents running for President, which is directly relevant to Kamala Harris's situation.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Kamala Harris has strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters [Q0.Q0]\n- Harris's campaign has seen unprecedented fundraising success, raising over $200 million in the first week [Q1.Q1]\n- Harris has received significant endorsements from high-profile Democrats, including President Joe Biden [Q4.Q4]\n- Recent analyses from FiveThirtyEight indicate that Harris's chances have improved significantly following Biden's withdrawal from the race [Q5.Q5]\n\n*Cons*: \n- A plurality of Americans believe that Donald Trump is more likely to win the Presidential Election compared to Kamala Harris [Q0.Q0]\n- Harris has faced criticism for her limited media engagement and lack of detailed policy plans [Q1.Q1]\n- In a head-to-head matchup, Trump leads Harris by 5 points according to Rasmussen Reports [Q0.Q0]\n- Historical success rate of female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections is notably low [Q0.Q1]\n- Prediction markets show skepticism about Harris's chances, with significant sentiment that other candidates might overshadow her [Q3.Q3]\n\n*Reasoning*: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 33%. Given the strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters, I'll adjust up by 5% to 38%. The unprecedented fundraising success and significant endorsements from high-profile Democrats, including President Joe Biden, warrant another upward adjustment of 7%, bringing it to 45%. However, the plurality of Americans believing Trump is more likely to win and the head-to-head matchup showing Trump leading Harris by 5 points necessitate a downward adjustment of 10%, bringing it to 35%. The historical success rate of female candidates and the skepticism in prediction markets further justify a downward adjustment of 5%, bringing the final prediction to 30%.\n\n*Prediction*: 30.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 2\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- In U.S. history, twelve sitting Vice Presidents have run for President while in office. Out of these twelve, four have been elected to the presidency, which translates to a success rate of approximately 33% [S2.Q0]\n- Historically, the success rate for Vice Presidents ascending to the Presidency through election is relatively low. Only five Vice Presidents have successfully won the Presidency through an election: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren, Richard Nixon, and George H.W. Bush [S2.Q3]\n- 39% of Metaculus questions resolved positively in 2018 [S2.Q0]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.33\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 33% because it directly pertains to the historical success rate of sitting Vice Presidents running for President, which is highly relevant to Kamala Harris's situation.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Kamala Harris has strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters [S1.Q0]\n- Harris's campaign has seen unprecedented fundraising success, raising over $200 million in the first week [S1.Q1]\n- Harris has received significant endorsements from key Democratic figures, including President Joe Biden and California Governor Gavin Newsom [S1.Q4]\n- Recent analyses from FiveThirtyEight indicate that Harris's chances have improved significantly following Biden's withdrawal from the race [S1.Q5]\n- Voter turnout among demographic groups that support Kamala Harris, such as women and Asians, has increased in recent elections [S2.Q7]\n\n*Cons*: \n- A plurality of Americans (42%) believe that Donald Trump is more likely to win the Presidential Election compared to 39% who think Kamala Harris would be more likely to win [S1.Q0]\n- In a head-to-head matchup, Trump leads Harris by 5 points (49% to 44%) according to Rasmussen Reports [S1.Q0]\n- Harris has faced criticism for her limited media engagement since launching her campaign [S1.Q1]\n- Harris's campaign has been criticized for a lack of concrete policy plans on her campaign website [S1.Q1]\n- The historical success rate of female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections is notably low [S2.Q1]\n\n*Reasoning*: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 33%. Kamala Harris has strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters, which is a positive sign, so I'll adjust up by 3% to 36%. Her unprecedented fundraising success and significant endorsements from key Democratic figures are also strong positives, so I'll adjust up by another 4% to 40%. Recent analyses from FiveThirtyEight indicating improved chances following Biden's withdrawal add another 2%, bringing it to 42%. However, the plurality of Americans believing Trump is more likely to win and the head-to-head matchup showing Trump leading by 5 points are significant negatives, so I'll adjust down by 5% to 37%. Her limited media engagement and lack of concrete policy plans are also concerning, so I'll adjust down by another 3% to 34%. Finally, considering the historical low success rate of female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections, I'll adjust down by 2% to 32%.\n\n*Prediction*: 32.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 3\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- Since World War II, incumbents have always won re-election when there was no recession, suggesting a high base rate for incumbents [S2.Q2]\n- Out of 43 presidents, only 16 won two consecutive elections, indicating a base rate of approximately 37% for re-election [S2.Q2]\n- Twelve sitting Vice Presidents have run for President while in office, with four winning, giving a base rate of approximately 33% [S2.Q0]\n- Historically, female candidates have a low success rate in U.S. Presidential elections, with no woman winning the presidency yet [S2.Q1]\n- 39% of Metaculus questions resolved positively in 2018 [S2.Q2]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.33\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: The most appropriate base rate is 33% for sitting Vice Presidents running for President. This base rate is specific to the scenario of a sitting Vice President running for President, which closely matches Kamala Harris's situation. It is more relevant than general incumbency or female candidate success rates.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Kamala Harris has strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters [S2.Q0]\n- Harris's campaign has seen unprecedented fundraising success, raising over $200 million in the first week [S2.Q1]\n- Harris has received significant endorsements from key Democratic figures, including President Joe Biden [S2.Q4]\n- Recent polls show Harris performing better nationally after Biden's withdrawal [S2.Q5]\n\n*Cons*: \n- A plurality of Americans believe Donald Trump is more likely to win the Presidential Election [S2.Q0]\n- Harris has faced criticism for limited media engagement and lack of detailed policy plans [S2.Q1]\n- In a head-to-head matchup, Trump leads Harris by 5 points according to Rasmussen Reports [S2.Q0]\n- Historical success rate of female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections is low [S2.Q1]\n- Prediction markets show skepticism about Harris's chances, with significant sentiment that other candidates might overshadow her [S2.Q3]\n\n*Reasoning*: Starting with the chosen base rate of 33% for sitting Vice Presidents running for President. Harris has strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters, which is a positive factor, so I'll adjust up by 5% to 38%. Her unprecedented fundraising success is another positive factor, so I'll adjust up by another 5% to 43%. Significant endorsements from key Democratic figures also support her chances, so I'll adjust up by 2% to 45%. Recent polls showing Harris performing better nationally after Biden's withdrawal is a positive sign, so I'll adjust up by 2% to 47%. However, a plurality of Americans believe Trump is more likely to win, which is a negative factor, so I'll adjust down by 3% to 44%. Criticism for limited media engagement and lack of detailed policy plans is another negative factor, so I'll adjust down by 2% to 42%. The head-to-head matchup where Trump leads Harris by 5 points is a significant negative factor, so I'll adjust down by 5% to 37%. The low historical success rate of female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections is another negative factor, so I'll adjust down by 2% to 35%. Finally, prediction markets show skepticism about Harris's chances, which is a significant negative factor, so I'll adjust down by 5% to 30%.\n\n*Prediction*: 30.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 4\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- Since World War II, incumbents have always won re-election when there was no recession, indicating a high success rate for incumbents in favorable economic conditions [S2.Q2]\n- Out of 43 presidents, only 16 won two consecutive elections, indicating a success rate of approximately 37% for re-election [S2.Q2]\n- Twelve sitting Vice Presidents have run for President while in office, with a success rate of approximately 33% [S2.Q0]\n- Historically, five Vice Presidents have successfully won the Presidency through an election, indicating a success rate of 29% [S3.Q3]\n- Female candidates have a very low historical success rate in U.S. Presidential elections, with no woman having won the presidency yet [S2.Q1]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.33\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: The most appropriate base rate is 33% for sitting Vice Presidents running for President. This base rate is specific to the scenario of a sitting Vice President running for President and accounts for historical precedents.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Kamala Harris has strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters [S1.Q0]\n- Harris has seen unprecedented fundraising success, raising over $200 million in the first week of her campaign [S1.Q1]\n- Harris has received significant endorsements from key Democratic figures, including President Joe Biden [S3.Q4]\n- Recent analyses from FiveThirtyEight indicate that Harris's chances have improved significantly following Biden's withdrawal from the race [S3.Q5]\n- Voter turnout among demographic groups that support Harris, such as women and Asians, has increased in recent elections [S3.Q7]\n\n*Cons*: \n- A plurality of Americans believe Donald Trump is more likely to win the Presidential Election [S1.Q0]\n- Harris has faced criticism for limited media engagement and lack of concrete policy plans [S1.Q1]\n- Trump leads Harris by 5 points in a head-to-head matchup according to Rasmussen Reports [S1.Q0]\n- Female candidates have historically had a very low success rate in U.S. Presidential elections [S2.Q1]\n- Harris's campaign has been criticized for avoiding press conferences and interviews, raising questions about her transparency [S3.Q6]\n\n*Reasoning*: Starting with the base rate of 33% for sitting Vice Presidents running for President.

Increased voter turnout among demographic groups that support Harris is a positive sign, so I'll adjust up by 2% to 45%. However, the plurality of Americans believing Trump is more likely to win and Trump's lead in head-to-head matchups are significant negatives, so I'll adjust down by 7% to 38%. Criticisms of limited media engagement and lack of concrete policy plans, as well as the historical low success rate of female candidates, are additional negatives, so I'll adjust down by another 5% to 33%. Finally, criticism for avoiding press conferences and interviews is a minor negative, so I'll adjust down by 1% to 32%.\n\n*Prediction*: 32.0%\n\n\n\n",

Recent analyses from FiveThirtyEight indicating improved chances following Biden's withdrawal add another 2%, bringing it to 42%. However, the plurality of Americans believing Trump is more likely to win and the head-to-head matchup showing Trump leading by 5 points are significant negatives, so I'll adjust down by 5% to 37%. Her limited media engagement and lack of concrete policy plans are also concerning, so I'll adjust down by another 3% to 34%.

Adjusted up for strong polling in battleground states and high retention of 2020 voters, and significant fundraising. Adjusted down for multiple legal challenges, lower campaign visibility, and mixed polling accuracy.\n- *Forecaster 1*: [Predicted 67.0%] Chose a base rate of 74% based on the re-election success rate of U.S. presidents. Adjusted up for leading in key battleground states and strong support from 2020 voters. Adjusted down for multiple legal challenges, impeachment, and financial scandals.\n- *Forecaster 2*: [Predicted 65.0%] Chose a base rate of 74% reflecting the historical success rate of presidents seeking re-election. Adjusted up for leading in battleground states and strong fundraising. Adjusted down for legal challenges, lower campaign visibility, and Harris leading among new voters.\n- *Forecaster 3*: [Predicted 67.0%] Chose a base rate of 74% based on incumbents' re-election success. Adjusted up for strong fundraising and support from 2020 voters. Adjusted down for legal challenges, mixed social media impact, and close polling averages in battleground states.\n- *Forecaster 4*: [Predicted 66.0%] Chose a base rate of 74% based on re-election success rate of U.S. presidents. Adjusted up for strong fundraising and support in battleground states. Adjusted down for legal challenges, less visible campaign activity, and trailing in prediction markets.\n\n## Summary of the Research\nThe research focused on various factors influencing Donald Trump's chances of winning the 2024 US Presidential Election. Key points include Trump's strong polling in battleground states, retaining 90% of his 2020 voters, and significant fundraising efforts. However, he faces multiple legal challenges, including a ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court that he engaged in insurrection, making him ineligible to hold the office of President, pending review by the United States Supreme Court. Additionally, his campaign activity appears less visible compared to previous cycles, and skipping debates may have hurt his standing in the polls [S1.Q0, S1.Q1, S1.Q7].\n\nThe research also examined historical data and base rates, such as the 74% re-election success rate of U.S. presidents who sought re-election in the past 100 years. Polling data has had a mixed record in predicting election outcomes, with an actual accuracy closer to 60%. The leader in national polls three months before the election has won only half the time in the past ten presidential campaigns. Additionally, there are no historical precedents of a major party candidate with significant legal troubles winning the US Presidential Election [S2.Q0, S2.Q2, S2.Q5, S2.Q3].\n\n## Possible Base Rates\n- In the past 100 years, 14 out of 19 U.S. presidents who sought re-election were successful, giving a re-election success rate of approximately 74% [S2.Q0]\n- Less than half of all U.S. presidents who have served have been re-elected to a second term in office, with 21 presidents winning a second term [S2.Q0]\n- The leader in national polls three months before the election has won the election only half the time in the past ten presidential campaigns [S2.Q5]\n- Polling data has had a mixed record in predicting the winner of the US Presidential Election over the last 50 years, with an accuracy closer to 60% [S2.Q2]\n- 39% of Metaculus questions resolved positively in 2018 [S2.Q0]\n\n## Pros\n- Donald Trump is leading in 5 of the 7 battleground states that are most likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential Election [S1.Q0]\n- Trump retains the support of 90% of those who voted for him in 2020 [S1.Q0]\n- Trump's campaign has managed to raise significant funds, reportedly pulling in \\$7.1 million since his mug shot was taken in Atlanta, and nearly \\$20 million over three weeks following his indictments and arraignment [S1.Q1]\n- LaRouchePAC has officially endorsed Donald Trump for the 2024 Presidential Election [S1.Q6]\n- A significant majority of Republican primary voters believe that Trump is the best candidate to beat Joe Biden in the 2024 election [S1.Q6]\n\n## Cons\n- Trump faces multiple legal challenges, including a ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court that he engaged in insurrection, making him ineligible to hold the office of President, pending review by the United States Supreme Court [S1.Q7]\n- Trump is under investigation by Atlanta-area prosecutor Fani Willis for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia, with potential charges looming [S1.Q7]\n- Trump's campaign activity appears to be less visible compared to previous election cycles [S1.Q1]\n- Skipping debates may have hurt Trump's standing in the polls [S1.Q1]\n- Polling and betting markets indicate that Trump is trailing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by a significant margin [S1.Q3]\n\n## Weaknesses and possible improvements\n- *Inconsistent Polling Data Interpretation*: The research mentions mixed accuracy of polling data but does not reconcile this with the reliance on current polling data for predictions. Quote: \"Polling data has had a mixed record in predicting the winner of the US Presidential Election over the last 50 years\" [S2.Q2]\n- *Overemphasis on Fundraising*: While significant, the research may overemphasize the impact of fundraising without adequately considering other factors like voter sentiment and legal challenges. Quote: \"Having a robust fundraising lead is generally a strong predictor of success in U.S. Presidential Elections\" [S2.Q4]\n- *Lack of Resolution Criteria*: The research does not provide specific resolution criteria for what constitutes a \"win\" in the context of the 2024 election, which could lead to ambiguity in interpreting the results. Quote: \"No resolution criteria provided\" [Question details]\n\n\n# S1: BACKGROUND Q&A\n## Q0: What is the current polling data for Donald Trump in the 2024 US Presidential Election?\nAnswer:\nAs of the latest polling data, Donald Trump is leading in 5 of the 7 battleground states that are most likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential Election \\[[1](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/presidential-polling-averages/?itid=co_election2024_2#:~:text=Note%3A%20Following%20President%20Joe%20Biden%E2%80%99s%20%20%20decision%20to%20withdraw%20from%20the%20presidential%20race%20%20%2C%20Vice%20President%20Kamala%20Harris%20is%20the%20Democratic%20Party%E2%80%99s%20nominee)\\]\\[[5](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/presidential-polling-averages/?itid=co_election2024_2#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20is%20leading%20in%205%20of%20the%207%20battleground%20states%20that%20are%20most%20likely%20to%20determine%20the%20outcome%20of%20the%20election)\\].

[Redfield & Wilton Strategies](https://redfieldandwiltonstrategies.com/joe-biden-administration-approval-ratings-and-hypothetical-voting-intention-7-august-2024/)\n## Q1: What are recent news articles saying about Donald Trump's campaign performance?\nAnswer:\nRecent news articles provide a mixed picture of Donald Trump's campaign performance for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Here are some key points:\n\n- **Legal Troubles and Fundraising**: Trump's legal issues have intensified, with multiple indictments related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. Despite these challenges, his campaign has managed to raise significant funds, reportedly pulling in $7.1 million since his mug shot was taken in Atlanta, and nearly $20 million over three weeks following his indictments and arraignment \\[[6](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/26/politics/trump-mugshot-fundraising-campaign/index.html#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20legal%20troubles%20have%20mounted%20in%20recent%20weeks%2C%20with%20prosecutors%20bringing%20two%20indictments%20related%20to%20his%20attempts%20to%20overturn%20the%202020%20election%20results)\\]\\[[14](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/26/politics/trump-mugshot-fundraising-campaign/index.html#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20campaign%20says%20it%20has%20raised%20%247)\\]. This suggests that his legal troubles may be galvanizing his base and boosting fundraising efforts.\n\n- **Social Media Strategy**: Trump has returned to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), where he has a much larger audience (90 million followers) compared to his own platform, Truth Social (7.6 million followers). However, his recent posts have not generated as much coverage as they once did, creating uncertainty about their impact on the electorate \\[[3](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4850705-trump-returns-x-social-media-platform/#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20posts%20over%20the%20last%20few%20days%20haven%E2%80%99t%20generated%20as%20much%20coverage%20as%20they%20once%20did)\\]\\[[4](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4850705-trump-returns-x-social-media-platform/#:~:text=The%20former%20president%20returned%20to%20the%20platform%20formerly%20known%20as%20Twitter%20on%20Aug)\\]\\[[7](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4850705-trump-returns-x-social-media-platform/#:~:text=Former%20President%20Trump%20is%20back%20on%20X%2C%20the%20social%20media%20platform%20formerly%20known%20as%20Twitter%2C%20seeking%20to%20expand%20his%20audience%20at%20a%20time%20when%20he%E2%80%99s%20losing%20ground%20to%20his%20new%20opponent%2C%20Vice%20President%20Harris)\\].\n\n- **Campaign Activity**: Trump's campaign activity appears to be less visible compared to previous election cycles. For instance, he has held fewer public events compared to his rivals and past campaigns. This low visibility strategy is similar to that of President Biden, who has also been running a campaign with minimal risk or visibility \\[[1](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/09/trump-biden-2024-presidential-campaign#:~:text=What%20they%27re%20saying%3A%20%22The%20President%20is%20running%20an%20aggressive%20and%20thoughtful%20official%20and%20campaign%20schedule%20that%20is%20in%20line%20with%20previous%20incumbent%20presidents%20at%20this%20point%20in%20the%20election%20cycle%2C%22%20said%20Kevin%20Munoz%2C%20a%20spokesperson%20for%20the%20Biden%20campaign)\\]\\[[10](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/09/trump-biden-2024-presidential-campaign#:~:text=%22%20%20%20By%20the%20numbers%3A%20Biden%20has%20held%20comparatively%20few%20public%20events%20past%206%20p)\\].\n\n- **Polling and Debates**: There is some indication that skipping debates may have hurt Trump's standing in the polls.

The provided sources primarily discuss the general unreliability of forecasts and the implications of a potential Harris presidency, rather than offering concrete data or predictions from Metaculus.\n\nHowever, for context, it is important to note that forecasts can be highly uncertain and subject to significant changes due to unforeseen events, as highlighted by historical examples such as the impact of 9/11 on George W.

They argue that Trump is the only candidate capable of uniting diverse groups including blue-collar families, scientists, engineers, and veterans \\[[11](https://www.larouchepac.com/larouchepac_endorsement_for_president_trump_s_2024_election_to_the_presidency_of_the_u_s_a#:~:text=President%20Trump%20is%20the%20only%20candidate%20capable%20of%20building%20a%20broad%20coalition%20of%20Americans%2C%20a%20coalition%20of%20producers%20uniting%20blue%20collar%20families%2C%20scientists%20and%20engineers%2C%20people%20of%20religious%20faith%2C%20veterans%2C%20farmers%2C%20immigrants%2C%20and%20many%20others)\\].\n\n2. **Republican Primary Voters' Sentiment**: According to a CBS News poll, a significant majority of Republican primary voters believe that Trump is the best candidate to beat Joe Biden in the 2024 election. Only 9% of likely Republican primary voters consider Trump a \"long shot\" against Biden, while more than 60% think he is a sure bet. This sentiment is crucial as it indicates strong intra-party support for Trump's candidacy \\[[13](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/28/opinion/donald-trump-presidential-campaign.html#:~:text=In%20polling%20by%20CBS%20News%2C%20the%20ability%20to%20beat%20Joe%20Biden%20is%20one%20of%20the%20top%20qualities%20Republican%20primary%20voters%20say%20they%20are%20looking%20for%2C%20and%20they%20think%20Mr)\\].\n\nThese endorsements and polling data suggest a strong base of support for Trump within the Republican Party, which could significantly impact his chances in the 2024 election.\n## Q7: Are there any significant events or scandals involving Donald Trump that could impact his chances of winning?\nAnswer:\nSeveral significant events and scandals involving Donald Trump could impact his chances of winning the US 2024 Election:\n\n1. **Legal Challenges and Indictments**: Trump faces multiple legal challenges, including a ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court that he engaged in insurrection, making him ineligible to hold the office of President. This decision is currently stayed pending review by the United States Supreme Court \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_presidential_eligibility_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=%20In%20December%202023%2C%20the%20Colorado%20Supreme%20Court%20in%20%20Anderson%20v)\\].

The events of January 6th and the subsequent investigations have continued to cast a shadow over his political career, potentially affecting his electability.\n\n3. **Financial and Fraud Allegations**: New York Attorney General Letitia James has accused Trump of inflating his net worth to secure favorable loan terms and insurance coverage. A New York judge has ordered an independent monitor to oversee the Trump Organization, and James is seeking to bar Trump and his children from running companies in New York and to recover $250 million allegedly obtained through fraud \\[[15](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-legal-problems-does-us-presidential-candidate-trump-face-2022-11-16/#:~:text=James%2C%20a%20Democrat%2C%20accused%20Trump%20of%20inflating%20his%20net%20worth%20by%20billions%20of%20dollars%20to%20obtain%20lower%20interest%20rates%20on%20loans%20and%20get%20better%20insurance%20coverage)\\]. These financial scandals could undermine his credibility and trustworthiness among voters.\n\nThese events collectively present substantial legal and ethical challenges that could influence public opinion and Trump's chances of winning the 2024 election.\n\n# S2: BASE RATE Q&A\n## Q0: What percentage of incumbents or former presidents have won re-election in the past 100 years?\nAnswer:\nIn the past 100 years, 14 out of 19 U.S. presidents who sought re-election were successful, giving a re-election success rate of approximately 74%. This includes presidents who were incumbents or former presidents running for a second term. Notably, Grover Cleveland is the only former president who has ever come back after being defeated for re-election to win a second nonconsecutive term \\[[14](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/11/16/few-former-presidents-have-run-for-their-old-jobs-or-anything-else-after-leaving-office/#:~:text=%20Grover%20Cleveland%20is%20the%20only%20former%20president%20who%20has%20ever%20come%20back%20after%20being%20defeated%20for%20reelection%20to%20win%20a%20second%20nonconsecutive%20term)\\]. \n\nFor a more detailed breakdown, less than half of all U.S. presidents who have served have been re-elected to a second term in office, with 21 presidents winning a second term, including those who assumed office after the death of a sitting president and later won election in their own right \\[[13](https://www.cnn.com/2012/11/09/politics/btn-second-term-presidents#:~:text=%29%20Less%20than%20half%20of%20U)\\]. This historical context can provide a useful benchmark for forecasting the likelihood of Donald Trump winning the 2024 election as a former president seeking re-election.\n## Q1: How often does the leading candidate in battleground state polls win the election?\nAnswer:\nThe accuracy of battleground state polls in predicting the winner of the U.S. presidential election has varied over recent election cycles. An analysis of the 2004, 2008, and 2012 elections found no significant differences in poll accuracy for 2004 and 2008, but significant underestimation of President Obama's performance in 2012 \\[[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2330443X.2015.1034389#:~:text=The%20presidential%20elections%20of%202004%2C%202008%2C%20and%202012%20are%20examined%2C%20and%20polling%20results%20for%20battleground%20states%20are%20compared%20to%20the%20actual%20margins%20in%20each%20state)\\]\\[[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2330443X.2015.1034389#:~:text=No%20significant%20differences%20in%20polls%20were%20found%20in%202004%20or%202008)\\]. This suggests that while battleground state polls can be indicative, they are not always reliable predictors.\n\nMoreover, the 2016 election highlighted the limitations of polling, as many polls failed to predict Donald Trump's victory, partly due to incorrect turnout models and the mobilization of less frequent voters \\[[7](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2018/10/30/are-2018-midterm-election-polls-accurate/#:~:text=In%20many%20states%2C%20there%20weren%E2%80%99t%20any%20polls%20or%20any%20good%20polls)\\]\\[[14](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2018/10/30/are-2018-midterm-election-polls-accurate/#:~:text=Polls%20most%20frequently%20go%20wrong%20because%20they%20don%E2%80%99t%20predict%20turnout%20correctly)\\]. In 2016, pollsters correctly called 83.8% of the state's electoral votes, yet this was insufficient to predict the overall outcome, with Trump securing 57% of the electoral college \\[[5](https://mark-blessington.medium.com/better-us-election-forecasting-b4f9c841f8e7#:~:text=In%202016%2C%20they%20called%2083)\\].\n\nIn summary, while leading candidates in battleground state polls often have an advantage, historical data shows that these polls are not infallible and can sometimes significantly misestimate outcomes due to various factors such as turnout prediction errors and voter mobilization dynamics.\n## Q2: What is the historical accuracy of polling data in predicting the winner of the US Presidential Election in the last 50 years?\nAnswer:\nPolling data has had a mixed record in predicting the winner of the US Presidential Election over the last 50 years. While Gallup and other major polling organizations have often been accurate, they have missed the mark in several close elections. Notable misses include the 1948, 1976, and 2004 elections, as well as the popular vote in 2000 and the likely-voter numbers in 2012 \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_polling_for_United_States_presidential_elections#:~:text=%20Gallup%20was%20the%20first%20polling%20organization%20to%20conduct%20accurate%20opinion%20polling%20for%20United%20States%20presidential%20elections)\\]\\[[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_polling_for_United_States_presidential_elections#:~:text=Gallup%20polling%20has%20often%20been%20accurate%20in%20predicting%20the%20outcome%20of%20presidential%20elections%20and%20the%20margin%20of%20victory%20for%20the%20winner)\\].

This suggests that while polls can provide a general sense of the election landscape, they are not infallible and can be influenced by unforeseen events and methodological issues.\n## Q3: How often has the candidate with significant legal troubles won the US Presidential Election?\nAnswer:\nIn the context of the larger question \"Will Donald Trump win the US 2024 Election?\", historical data on candidates with significant legal troubles winning the US Presidential Election is quite limited. The most notable example is Eugene V. Debs, who ran for president from prison in 1920 on the Socialist Party ticket and garnered almost a million votes, or about 3% of the total, but did not win \\[[9](https://apnews.com/article/trump-prison-run-for-president-e9fb5f5f94c5bd5960bb7d8ee37a336d#:~:text=He%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20even%20be%20the%20first%20candidate%20to%20run%20for%20that%20office%20while%20imprisoned)\\]\\[[10](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2023/04/01/trump-prison-eugene-debs/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_main#:~:text=Eight%20years%20earlier%2C%20he%E2%80%99d%20won%20901%2C551%20votes%20%E2%80%94%20about%20six%20percent%20of%20the%20vote)\\]. This case is different from Trump's situation as Debs was a fringe candidate, whereas Trump is a former president and a major party nominee.\n\nThere are no historical precedents of a major party candidate with significant legal troubles winning the US Presidential Election. This lack of precedent suggests that while it is not impossible, it is highly unusual and would be an outlier in US political history.\n## Q4: How often has the candidate with a robust fundraising lead won the US Presidential Election?\nAnswer:\nIn the context of the larger question \"Will Donald Trump win the US 2024 Election?\", historical data suggests that having a robust fundraising lead is generally a strong predictor of success in U.S. Presidential Elections. Specifically, total fundraising is a better predictor of success in a presidential primary, regardless of its source. Each ten-percentage-point increase in a candidate\u2019s share of total party fundraising during a primary election increases the candidate\u2019s likelihood of winning the nomination by 20% \\[[1](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=Each%20ten-percentage-point%20increase%20in%20a%20candidate%E2%80%99s%20share%20of%20total%20party%20fundraising%20during%20a%20primary%20election%20increases%20the%20candidate%E2%80%99s%20likelihood%20of%20winning%20the%20nomination%20by%2020%25)\\]\\[[4](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=This%20does%20not%20appear%20to%20be%20driven%20by%20bandwagon%20effects)\\]\\[[8](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=At%20the%20start%20of%20the%20primary%20season%2C%20before%20ballots%20have%20been%20cast%2C%20winning%20candidates%20typically%20draw%2085%25%20of%20their%20money%20from%20large%20donors%2C%20compared%20with%2065%25%20for%20candidates%20who%20are%20ultimately%20unsuccessful)\\].\n\nHowever, there are notable exceptions. For instance, Donald Trump in 2016 raised a smaller share of his money from large donors (25%) than any successful primary candidate since the FEC began collecting data in 1976. Trump also received just 4% of the GOP\u2019s individual donations and would have been the first general election candidate not to lead his party in total campaign contributions since Ronald Reagan in 1980 \\[[1](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=Each%20ten-percentage-point%20increase%20in%20a%20candidate%E2%80%99s%20share%20of%20total%20party%20fundraising%20during%20a%20primary%20election%20increases%20the%20candidate%E2%80%99s%20likelihood%20of%20winning%20the%20nomination%20by%2020%25)\\]\\[[2](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=Raising%20a%20lot%20of%20money%20in%20relatively%20large%20increments%2C%20like%20Bill%20Clinton%20in%201992%20and%20Bush%20in%202000%2C%20is%20still%20a%20better%20strategy%20than%20raising%20more%20modest%20sums%20in%20smaller%20amounts%20like%20Jesse%20Jackson%20in%201988%20or%20Pat%20Buchanan%20in%201996)\\]\\[[11](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=If%20Donald%20Trump%20goes%20on%20to%20win%20the%20Republican%20nomination%2C%20this%20empirical%20relationship%20will%20be%20severely%20weakened)\\].

According to FiveThirtyEight's analysis, the leader in national polls at the end of April has won the election only half the time in the past ten presidential campaigns \\[[11](https://archive.nytimes.com/fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/what-do-springtime-polls-tell-us-about-the-general-election/#:~:text=But%2C%20of%20course%2C%20the%20election%20is%20still%20more%20than%20six%20months%20away%2C%20and%20in%20the%20past%2010%20presidential%20campaigns%2C%20the%20national%20polling%20leader%20in%20late%20April%20has%20won%20the%20election%20only%20half%20Drawn%20from%20FiveThirtyEight%E2%80%99s%20polling%20database%2C%20which%20includes%20thousands%20of%20surveys%2C%20here%20is%20the%20average%20of%20the%2010%20most%20recent%20national%20polls%20as%20of%20late%20April%20in%20each%20election%20year%20going%20back%20to%201972%20%28for%20the%201980%20election%20and%20before%2C%20fewer%20than%2010%20general%20election%20polls%20conducted%20in%20the%20first%20four%20months%20of%20the%20year%20were%20available%29)\\]. This suggests that while being ahead in the polls three months before the election can be an indicator of potential success, it is far from a guarantee.\n\nAdditionally, the reliability of early general election presidential trial heat polls has been questioned. Pew Research notes that early polls have a poor track record, with the political climate often changing significantly between the early polling period and the actual election \\[[6](https://www.pewresearch.org/2007/02/14/how-reliable-are-the-early-presidential-polls/#:~:text=One%20decided%20against%20a%20run%20%28New%20York%20Gov)\\]. This further underscores the uncertainty and potential for change in voter preferences as the election date approaches.\n\nIn summary, while leading in national polls three months before the election can provide some insight, historical data indicates that it is not a highly reliable predictor of the eventual election outcome.\n## Q6: How often does a candidate with strong intra-party support win the general election?\nAnswer:\nIn the context of the larger question \"Will Donald Trump win the US 2024 Election?\", it is important to consider the historical correlation between a candidate's intra-party support and their success in the general election. While the provided sources primarily focus on the correlation between a President's approval rating and their party's performance in midterm elections, they do offer some insights that can be extrapolated to general elections.\n\nHistorically, a President's approval rating has been a significant predictor of their party's performance in midterm elections. For instance, a study found a statistically significant linear model where the President's approval rating (x) correlated with the number of Congressional seats won or lost by the President's party (y) during midterm elections: \\( y = -107.423 + 1.594x \\) \\[[5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07545.pdf#:~:text=An%20analysis%20of%20the%20data%20yielded%20the%20statistically%20significant%20linear%20model%20y%20%3D%20-107)\\]. This model was more accurate for approval ratings above 50%, suggesting that higher approval ratings within the party can lead to better electoral outcomes. However, this correlation is moderate (correlation coefficient of 0.517) and primarily applies to midterm elections, not general elections \\[[13](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07545.pdf#:~:text=The%20seat%20gain%20is%20centered%20at%20-25%20seats%2C%20meaning%20that%20on%20average%20the%20President%27s%20party%20loses%20seats%20during%20Midterms)\\].\n\nWhile this data does not directly answer the question about general elections, it implies that strong intra-party support, as reflected in high approval ratings, can positively influence electoral outcomes. However, it is crucial to consider other factors such as the broader political climate, the candidate's appeal to independent and swing voters, and the overall campaign strategy.\n\nIn summary, while strong intra-party support is beneficial and correlates with better performance in midterm elections, its impact on general election outcomes is less direct and should be considered alongside other variables.\n## Q7: What is the historical impact of key endorsements on a candidate\u2019s chances of winning the US Presidential Election?\nAnswer:\nThe historical impact of key endorsements on a candidate\u2019s chances of winning the US Presidential Election is generally limited, though there are notable exceptions. For instance, Oprah Winfrey's endorsement of Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic Primary had a measurable impact, with 23% of Democrats indicating they were more likely to vote for Obama due to her endorsement \\[[1](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/celebrityendorsements_garthwaitemoore.pdf#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Pew%20Research%20Center%2C%2023%20percent%20of%20Democrats%20said%20that%20Winfrey%27s%20endorsement%20would%20make%20them%20more%20likely%20to%20vote%20for%20Obama%20%28Pew%20Research%20Center%2C%202007%20%29)\\]. This case is exceptional due to Winfrey's unique influence and the geographically varying indicators of her popularity, which were unrelated to political factors \\[[1](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/celebrityendorsements_garthwaitemoore.pdf#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Pew%20Research%20Center%2C%2023%20percent%20of%20Democrats%20said%20that%20Winfrey%27s%20endorsement%20would%20make%20them%20more%20likely%20to%20vote%20for%20Obama%20%28Pew%20Research%20Center%2C%202007%20%29)\\].\n\nHowever, most endorsements do not significantly alter election outcomes. Research indicates that endorsements often reflect the pre-existing attributes of a candidate, such as incumbency, party affiliation, and political savvy, rather than independently boosting their chances \\[[2](https://theconversation.com/trump-endorsed-candidates-would-generally-win-even-without-his-support-and-thats-usually-the-case-with-all-political-endorsements-184231#:~:text=But%20in%20most%20cases%2C%20their%20effects%20are%20far%20less%20potent%20than%20commentators%20might%20expect)\\]\\[[3](https://theconversation.com/trump-endorsed-candidates-would-generally-win-even-without-his-support-and-thats-usually-the-case-with-all-political-endorsements-184231#:~:text=Political%20science%20says%20that%20endorsements%20do%20occasionally%20matter%20for%20determining%20election%20outcomes)\\]. For example, the so-called \"Trump bump\" is largely a reflection of the candidate's existing strengths rather than the endorsement itself \\[[2](https://theconversation.com/trump-endorsed-candidates-would-generally-win-even-without-his-support-and-thats-usually-the-case-with-all-political-endorsements-184231#:~:text=But%20in%20most%20cases%2C%20their%20effects%20are%20far%20less%20potent%20than%20commentators%20might%20expect)\\]. Additionally, a survey of 804 likely Ohio voters during the 2016 presidential campaign found that the majority reported endorsements had no effect on their voting choice, although a substantial minority did report increased or decreased likelihood of support due to endorsements \\[[7](https://www.cleveland.com/opinion/2016/02/presidential_endorsements_incl.html#:~:text=We%20surveyed%20804%20likely%20Ohio%20general%20election%20voters%20to%20gauge%20the%20electoral%20effects%20of%20various%20traditional%20and%20celebrity%20endorsements)\\].\n\nIn summary, while specific high-profile endorsements like Oprah's can have a significant impact, most endorsements generally have a limited effect on changing voter behavior and election outcomes.\n\n# S3: FORECASTS\n*Median prediction*: 66.0%\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 0\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- In the past 100 years, 14 out of 19 U.S. presidents who sought re-election were successful, giving a re-election success rate of approximately 74% [Q0.Q0]\n- Less than half of all U.S. presidents who have served have been re-elected to a second term in office, with 21 presidents winning a second term [Q0.Q0]\n- The leader in national polls three months before the election has won the election only half the time in the past ten presidential campaigns [Q5.Q5]\n- Polling data has had a mixed record in predicting the winner of the US Presidential Election over the last 50 years, with an accuracy closer to 60% [Q2.Q2]\n- 39% of Metaculus questions resolved positively in 2018 [Q0.Q0]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.74\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: The most appropriate base rate is 74% because it is based on historical data of U.S. presidents who sought re-election, which is highly relevant to Donald Trump's situation as a former president seeking re-election.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Donald Trump is leading in 5 of the 7 battleground states that are most likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential Election [Q0.Q0]\n- Trump retains the support of 90% of those who voted for him in 2020 [Q0.Q0]\n- Trump's campaign has managed to raise significant funds, reportedly pulling in $7.1 million since his mug shot was taken in Atlanta, and nearly $20 million over three weeks following his indictments and arraignment [Q1.Q1]\n- LaRouchePAC has officially endorsed Donald Trump for the 2024 Presidential Election [Q6.Q6]\n- A significant majority of Republican primary voters believe that Trump is the best candidate to beat Joe Biden in the 2024 election [Q6.Q6]\n\n*Cons*: \n- Trump faces multiple legal challenges, including a ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court that he engaged in insurrection, making him ineligible to hold the office of President, pending review by the United States Supreme Court [Q7.Q7]\n- Trump is under investigation by Atlanta-area prosecutor Fani Willis for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia, with potential charges looming [Q7.Q7]\n- Trump's campaign activity appears to be less visible compared to previous election cycles [Q1.Q1]\n- Skipping debates may have hurt Trump's standing in the polls [Q1.Q1]\n- Polling and betting markets indicate that Trump is trailing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by a significant margin [Q3.Q3]\n\n*Reasoning*: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 74%.

The close polling averages in battleground states and potential impact of skipping debates further warrant a slight adjustment down by 2% to 67%.\n\n*Prediction*: 67.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 4\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- In the past 100 years, 14 out of 19 U.S. presidents who sought re-election were successful, giving a re-election success rate of approximately 74% [Q0.Q0]\n- Less than half of all U.S. presidents who have served have been re-elected to a second term in office, with 21 presidents winning a second term [Q0.Q0]\n- The accuracy of battleground state polls in predicting the winner of the U.S. presidential election has varied, with significant underestimation in some cases [Q1.Q1]\n- Polling data has had a mixed record in predicting the winner of the US Presidential Election over the last 50 years [Q2.Q2]\n- There are no historical precedents of a major party candidate with significant legal troubles winning the US Presidential Election [Q3.Q3]\n- Having a robust fundraising lead is generally a strong predictor of success in U.S. Presidential Elections [Q4.Q4]\n- The leader in national polls at the end of April has won the election only half the time in the past ten presidential campaigns [Q5.Q5]\n- Strong intra-party support correlates with better performance in midterm elections, but its impact on general election outcomes is less direct [Q6.Q6]\n- Most endorsements generally have a limited effect on changing voter behavior and election outcomes [Q7.Q7]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.74\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 74% because it directly pertains to the re-election success rate of U.S. presidents, which is the closest historical analogy to Trump's situation as a former president seeking re-election.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Donald Trump is leading in 5 of the 7 battleground states that are most likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential Election [Q0.Q0]\n- Trump retains the support of 90% of those who voted for him in 2020 [Q0.Q0]\n- Trump's campaign has managed to raise significant funds, pulling in $7.1 million since his mug shot was taken in Atlanta, and nearly $20 million over three weeks following his indictments and arraignment [Q1.Q1]\n- A significant majority of Republican primary voters believe that Trump is the best candidate to beat Joe Biden in the 2024 election [Q6.Q6]\n\n*Cons*: \n- Trump faces multiple legal challenges, including a ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court that he engaged in insurrection, making him ineligible to hold the office of President, pending review by the United States Supreme Court [Q7.Q7]\n- Trump's campaign activity appears to be less visible compared to previous election cycles [Q1.Q1]\n- Skipping debates may have hurt Trump's standing in the polls [Q1.Q1]\n- Among those who did not vote in 2020, Harris leads Trump by nine points (38% to 29%) [Q0.Q0]\n- Trump is trailing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by a significant margin on prediction markets, including PredictIt [Q3.Q3]\n\n*Reasoning*: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 74%. Trump's strong fundraising and support in battleground states are positive indicators, so I'll adjust up by 5% to 79%. However, his multiple legal challenges and less visible campaign activity are significant negatives, so I'll adjust down by 10% to 69%. The fact that Trump is trailing in prediction markets and has skipped debates, which may hurt his standing, warrants a further adjustment down by 5% to 64%. Finally, while he retains strong intra-party support, the mixed historical accuracy of polls and endorsements suggests caution, so I'll make a small upward adjustment of 2% to 66%.\n\n*Prediction*: 66.0%\n\n\n\n",
