Considering that there are significant existential risks identified and studied, I will make a small upward adjustment of 1% to account for these risks. However, given the robustness of global mitigation strategies, historical resilience, and the inaccuracy of past doomsday predictions, I will make a downward adjustment of 2%. Combining these adjustments, the final prediction is 5%.\n\n**Prediction**: 5.0%\n\n\n\n\n# QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n## Question: What are the major existential risks that could potentially cause the world to end by 2100?\n  Answer: In the context of the larger question 'Will the world end by 2100?', the major existential risks that could potentially cause the world to end by 2100 include:\n\n1. **Supervolcanic Eruptions**: These rare but catastrophic events have the potential to cause widespread destruction of ecosystems, disrupt global agriculture, and lead to long-term climate change. Examples include the Toba Caldera eruption 74,000 years ago and the Taupo Volcanic Zone eruption 26,500 years ago.\n\n2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The development of superintelligent AI poses significant risks if it becomes uncontrollable or misaligned with human values. This could lead to catastrophic consequences, including human extinction.\n\n3. **Nuclear War**: The use of nuclear weapons on a large scale could cause a global nuclear winter, leading to significant loss of life and potentially even human extinction.\n\n4. **Climate Change**: While climate change is often viewed as a gradual process, its cumulative effects could lead to catastrophic consequences, including sea-level rise, droughts, and extreme weather events, which could ultimately threaten human civilization.\n\n5. **Engineered Pathogens**: The creation and release of highly infectious and deadly pathogens could lead to global pandemics, potentially causing significant loss of life and even human extinction.\n\nThese risks are recognized by experts and superforecasters alike, and their likelihood and potential impact are being studied and debated in various forums and research initiatives.\n\nReferences:\n- https://globaia.org/risks\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23785731/human-extinction-forecasting-superforecasters\n- https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/un42vaZgyX7ch2kaj/announcing-forecasting-existential-risks-evidence-from-a\n## Question: How have predictions about existential risks changed over recent decades?\n  Answer: Predictions about existential risks have undergone significant changes over recent decades, reflecting advancements in scientific understanding and the increasing awareness of potential threats to humanity. Here are some key developments:\n\n1. **Early Recognition**: The concept of existential risks dates back to the 18th-century Enlightenment, when scientists began to consider the possibility of human extinction due to various catastrophes.\n\n2. **Supervolcanic Eruptions**: The threat of supervolcanic eruptions has been recognized as a significant existential risk. These events, such as the Toba eruption 74,000 years ago, can cause global cooling, disrupt agriculture, and lead to long-term climate change.\n\n3. **Climate Change**: Climate change has become a prominent existential risk, with many experts labeling it an \"existential threat.\" This threat is not only to human existence but also to our ways of life and cultural heritage. If left unchecked, climate change could lead to mass extinctions and significant disruptions to human societies.\n\n4. **Increased Awareness**: The study of existential risks has become more formalized, with the establishment of organizations like the Global Priorities Institute and the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk. These organizations focus on understanding and mitigating these risks.\n\n5. **Shift in Focus**: While earlier predictions focused on the literal extinction of humanity, more recent discussions have expanded to include the erosion of human cultures, traditions, and languages. This broader perspective acknowledges that even if humanity survives, the consequences of climate change and other risks can still have devastating impacts on our societies and ways of life.\n\n6. **Adaptation and Resilience**: There is a growing recognition of humanity's ability to adapt to extreme conditions. This includes the development of technological strategies, such as floating cities, and the need for infrastructure that can support large populations in a changing climate.\n\nIn summary, predictions about existential risks have evolved to encompass a wider range of threats, including supervolcanic eruptions and climate change. The focus has shifted from solely considering human extinction to also addressing the broader impacts on human societies and cultures.\n\nReferences:\n- https://globaia.org/risks\n- https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/why-do-some-people-call-climate-change-existential-threat\n- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001632871930357X\n- https://michigantoday.umich.edu/2021/06/25/will-the-earth-be-habitable-in-2100/\n## Question: How often have experts revised their predictions about existential risks?\n  Answer: Experts have revised their predictions about existential risks through iterative updates during the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament (XPT). The XPT involved a collaborative approach where participants, including experts and superforecasters, engaged in predicting future events and updating their views iteratively. This process allowed for the exchange of information and the refinement of forecasts over time.\n\nIn the XPT, experts and superforecasters were incentivized to discuss their reasoning and update their forecasts, both individually and in teams. This iterative process facilitated the revision of predictions as participants considered diverse perspectives and new information.\n\nWhile the specific frequency of revisions is not explicitly stated, the XPT's methodology emphasizes the importance of iterative updates in refining predictions. This approach acknowledges that forecasting is an ongoing process that benefits from continuous refinement and adaptation to new information.\n\nReferences:\n- https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23785731/human-extinction-forecasting-superforecasters\n- https://forecastingresearch.org/xpt\n- https://www.freethink.com/robots-ai/ai-predictions-superforecasters\n## Question: What historical precedents exist for global catastrophic events?\n  Answer: Historical precedents for global catastrophic events include several significant natural disasters and environmental crises that have had devastating impacts on human populations and the environment. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Mount Tambora Eruption (1815)**: This volcanic eruption in Indonesia is considered the largest in recorded history, causing widespread destruction and a global climate anomaly known as the \"Year Without a Summer\" in 1816.\n\n2. **1931 China Floods**: Heavy rainfall in Central China led to massive flooding along the Yangzi, Huai, and Yellow rivers, resulting in an estimated death toll of up to 4 million people.\n\n3. **2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami**: A magnitude 9.1 earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that affected several countries in Southeast Asia, causing approximately 227,000 deaths and significant economic damage.\n\n4. **2023 Turkey-Syria Earthquake**: A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck south-central Turkey, causing widespread destruction and over 50,000 confirmed deaths in Turkey and Syria.\n\nThese historical events demonstrate the potential for natural disasters to have catastrophic consequences on a global scale. Understanding these precedents can inform predictions about the likelihood and potential impacts of future global catastrophic events.\n\nReferences:\n- https://www.livescience.com/biggest-natural-disasters-throughout-history\n- https://www.directrelief.org/2019/12/10-disasters-that-changed-the-world/\n## Question: What mitigation strategies are currently in place to address existential risks?\n  Answer: To address existential risks, several mitigation strategies are currently in place or being proposed:\n\n1. **Regulation of Chemical and Biological Weapons**: Efforts to regulate these weapons aim to reduce the risk of global catastrophes. This includes international agreements and treaties to limit the development and use of such weapons.\n\n2. **Nuclear Risk Reduction**: Measures to reduce the threat of nuclear conflict, such as arms reduction treaties and diplomatic efforts to prevent nuclear escalation, are crucial in mitigating existential risks.\n\n3. **Climate Change Mitigation**: While climate change is not generally considered an existential risk in itself, its impacts can contribute to other risks. Strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources and increasing energy efficiency, are essential in mitigating its effects.\n\n4. **Existential Risk Research and Funding**: Supporting research and organizations focused on existential risk mitigation can have significant impacts. This includes funding for research into AI safety, biological weapons, and other areas of high risk.\n\n5. **Whole-of-Society Approach**: Encouraging collective action and coordination among governments, academia, business, and civil society is crucial in addressing existential risks.

Here are some key developments and insights:\n\n1. **Recognition of Existential Risks**: The concept of existential risks has gained recognition, with experts identifying various threats such as global nuclear war, climate change, and pandemics. These risks are acknowledged as potentially catastrophic and requiring international cooperation to mitigate.\n\n2. **International Institutions**: Existing international agencies like the World Health Organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the United Nations\u2019s Office for Disarmament Affairs have been recognized as hubs for international coordination. However, these agencies often lack sufficient power and scope to respond effectively to existential risks.\n\n3. **Need for Multilateral Agreements**: There is a growing consensus on the need for multilateral agreements with strong enforcement clauses to address existential risks. Such agreements should include mechanisms for identifying urgent risks, obligating nations to take action, and allowing for international assistance and enforcement.\n\n4. **Climate Change**: Climate change is a prominent existential risk, and efforts to address it have been ongoing. The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, but current progress is insufficient, and more drastic measures are needed to meet this goal.\n\n5. **Long-term Perspective**: Scientists emphasize the importance of considering the long-term implications of climate change, drawing parallels with historical mass extinctions. This perspective highlights the need for sustained efforts beyond the year 2100 to mitigate the effects of climate change.\n\nIn summary, while there is increased recognition of existential risks and the need for global cooperation, significant challenges persist. Strengthening international institutions and developing more effective multilateral agreements are crucial steps towards mitigating these risks.\n\nReferences:\n- https://seri.stanford.edu\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.theregreview.org/2020/06/11/kohler-need-global-protections-against-existential-risks/\n- https://michigantoday.umich.edu/2021/06/25/will-the-earth-be-habitable-in-2100/\n- https://www.theguardian.com/music/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/29/if-the-world-ends-in-2100-were-probably-ok\n## Question: What are the scientific and technological trends that could either mitigate or exacerbate existential risks?\n  Answer: To help the superforecaster make a better prediction on the question \"Will the world end by 2100?\", it is essential to consider the scientific and technological trends that could either mitigate or exacerbate existential risks. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n### Mitigating Trends:\n1. **Advancements in AI Safety**:\n   - **Regulatory Efforts**: Policymakers are working to establish stricter regulations and safeguards to prevent the misuse of AI.

Here are some relevant findings:\n\n1. **Superforecasters' Estimates**:\n   - A group of \"superforecasters\" and experts participated in the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament, which aimed to generate accurate forecasts concerning the threats confronting humanity in the next century. The median expert projected a 6 percent likelihood of human extinction, while the superforecasters suggested a 9 percent probability of a catastrophic event and a 1 percent chance of extinction by 2100.\n\n2. **Metaculus Predictions**:\n   - Metaculus, a prediction platform, hosts questions related to global warming by 2100. For instance, one question asks about the likelihood of a 3.6\u00b0C global warming by 2100, which will resolve as Yes if there is a 5-year period before January 1, 2100, with an average global temperature of at least 3.6\u00b0C in each year.\n\n3. **Climate Change Projections**:\n   - Climate change research suggests that the current rate of human-induced carbon emissions is driving rapid global warming trends. While efforts to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C face skepticism, there remains a prospect of mitigating the catastrophic effects of climate change on a longer timescale by reducing and potentially reversing emissions.\n\nThese sources provide insights into the likelihood of the world ending by 2100, highlighting the perspectives of superforecasters, prediction markets, and climate change research.\n\nReferences:\n- https://www.theguardian.com/music/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/29/if-the-world-ends-in-2100-were-probably-ok\n- https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23785731/human-extinction-forecasting-superforecasters\n- https://humanefutureofwork.com/what-will-the-world-be-like-in-2100/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1539/36c-global-warming-by-2100/\n## Question: What are historical rates of global catastrophic events (e.g., pandemics, wars, natural disasters)?\n  Answer: To provide a well-informed answer to the question about historical rates of global catastrophic events, it is essential to consider various types of catastrophes and their frequencies. Here is a summary of the historical rates of such events:\n\n1. **Catastrophes killing 1% of the global population within a decade**: Since 1500, there have been 11 such events, which translates to a base rate of these catastrophes.\n\n2. **Extinctions of species and mass extinction events**: These events can provide additional context for understanding the frequency of catastrophes. While data on human events is limited, extinctions suggest that the rate of catastrophes can vary significantly over time.\n\n3. **Pandemics**: The COVID-19 pandemic is a recent example of a global health crisis. Historical pandemics, such as the Spanish Flu, have had significant impacts on global populations.\n\n4. **Wars**: Major conflicts like World War I and II have resulted in significant loss of life and global instability. Historical records of wars can help in understanding their frequency and impact.\n\n5. **Natural disasters**: Events like earthquakes, hurricanes, and tsunamis have caused significant destruction and loss of life throughout history. Analyzing the frequency and impact of these events can inform predictions about future catastrophes.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding historical rates of global catastrophic events involves considering various types of catastrophes, including those related to population, extinctions, pandemics, wars, and natural disasters. By analyzing these events, we can better estimate the likelihood of such events occurring in the future.\n\nReferences:\n- https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/base-rates-of-catastrophes/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/help/prediction-resources/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.metaculus.com\n## Question: What are the most reliable sources of information and data regarding existential risks?\n  Answer: To provide the most reliable sources of information and data regarding existential risks, I have compiled a list of sources that are widely recognized and respected in the field of existential risk research.\n\n1. **Globa\u00efa**: This organization provides detailed information on various existential risks, including supervolcanic eruptions, which are considered significant threats to human civilization.

This uncertainty could lead to unforeseen consequences and affect the accuracy of predictions about the end of the world.\n\nReferences:\n- https://michigantoday.umich.edu/2021/06/25/will-the-earth-be-habitable-in-2100/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/14965/forecasting-our-world-in-data-the-next-100-years/\n- https://climatechange.chicago.gov/climate-change-science/future-climate-change\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/1539/36c-global-warming-by-2100/\n## Question: How have past predictions about the end of the world (e.g., Y2K, 2012 Mayan calendar) fared in terms of accuracy?\n  Answer: Past predictions about the end of the world have consistently been inaccurate. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **2012 Maya Apocalypse**: The end of the Maya Long Count calendar on December 21, 2012, was misinterpreted as the end of the world. Predictions included a collision with the imaginary planet Nibiru, giant solar flares, and a planetary alignment causing massive tidal catastrophes. None of these events occurred.\n\n2. **Harold Camping**: Harold Camping, a prolific predictor of end times, made multiple predictions, including one for May 21, 2011, and another for October 21, 2011. Both dates passed without incident.\n\n3. **True Way**: Taiwanese religious leader Hon-Ming Chen predicted that God would appear on U.S. television channel 18 on March 25, 1988, and that millions of devil spirits would cause a mass extinction of the human population in the following year. These predictions did not materialize.\n\n4. **Halley\u2019s Comet Panic**: In 1910, the approach of Halley\u2019s comet led to fears that it would destroy the planet. This prediction was also incorrect.\n\n5. **Millerism**: William Miller predicted the end of the world in 1843 and then recalculated to 1844. Both predictions failed to come true.\n\n6. **Joanna Southcott**: Joanna Southcott predicted that she would give birth to the second messiah in 1814, signaling the end of the world. She died before this could happen.\n\n7. **The Prophet Hen of Leeds**: A hen in Leeds, England, was believed to have laid eggs with the message \"Christ is coming.\" This was later discovered to be a hoax.\n\n8. **Earth Day Predictions**: Around the first Earth Day in 1970, several predictions were made about the imminent end of the world due to environmental disasters. These predictions, including those by George Wald, Barry Commoner, and Paul Ehrlich, were spectacularly wrong.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that past predictions about the end of the world have been consistently inaccurate. This information can help inform predictions about the likelihood of the world ending by 2100.\n\nReferences:\n- https://www.britannica.com/list/10-failed-doomsday-predictions\n- https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/18-spectacularly-wrong-predictions-were-made-around-the-time-of-the-first-earth-day-in-1970-expect-more-this-year/\n## Question: What is the role of human behavior and decision-making in mitigating or exacerbating existential risks?\n  Answer: The role of human behavior and decision-making in mitigating or exacerbating existential risks is crucial in determining whether the world will end by 2100. Human behavior and decision-making can significantly impact the likelihood and severity of existential risks, which include threats such as climate change, nuclear war, and pandemics.\n\n### Mitigating Existential Risks\n\n1. **Ecological Footprint Analysis**: Professor William Rees, the originator of ecological footprint analysis, emphasizes the need for a dynamic, equitable steady-state economy to satisfy basic human needs and mitigate environmental degradation.\n\n2. **Futures Thinking**: Iker, in his article on the future of work, highlights the importance of futures thinking in identifying and building desirable futures. This approach encourages proactive decision-making to steer reality towards a more sustainable and humane direction.\n\n3. **Existential Risk Reduction**: The astronomical value thesis suggests that reducing existential risk can have immense value. However, this requires abandoning pessimism and adopting a more optimistic view of humanity's ability to manage risks effectively. This can be achieved by establishing institutions dedicated to preventing existential risks and fostering a culture of wisdom and responsible technology management.\n\n### Exacerbating Existential Risks\n\n1. **Pessimism and Risk Perception**: Research on the psychology of existential risk indicates that people often underestimate the long-term consequences of catastrophes. This neglect can lead to a lack of urgency in addressing these risks, thereby exacerbating them.\n\n2. **Technological Risks**: The development of new technologies can pose unprecedented destructive capabilities, increasing existential risks if not managed wisely. Pessimists argue that humanity's technological capabilities are growing faster than our wisdom to handle them, making it essential to prioritize wisdom and risk management.\n\nIn conclusion, human behavior and decision-making play a critical role in mitigating or exacerbating existential risks. By adopting a proactive, futures-thinking approach and prioritizing wisdom and risk management, humanity can reduce the likelihood of existential risks and create a more sustainable future.\n\nReferences:\n- https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/the-way-forward-survival-2100\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-50145-9\n- https://humanefutureofwork.com/what-will-the-world-be-like-in-2100/\n- https://philarchive.org/archive/THOHRL\n## Question: What are the latest advancements in global monitoring and early warning systems for existential threats?\n  Answer: The latest advancements in global monitoring and early warning systems for existential threats include significant developments in artificial intelligence (AI), multi-hazard early warning systems, and international collaborations to enhance forecasting and response strategies.\n\n### Artificial Intelligence (AI) Advancements\n\n- **Generative AI**: Recent dramatic advances in generative AI have sparked debate about its potential existential risks. While some experts argue that these risks are highly speculative, others highlight the potential for AI to accelerate information corruption and deformation, which could hinder effective responses to urgent threats like nuclear war, pandemics, and climate change.\n- **AI in Early Warning Systems**: AI is rapidly transforming early warning systems, offering significant advancements in disaster risk management. Examples include Google's global flood forecasting initiative, Microsoft's work on exposure data in Ethiopia, and Everbridge's innovative communication solutions. These developments aim to make early warning systems more accessible and effective across different regions and challenges.\n\n### Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems\n\n- **Early Warnings for All (EW4All) Initiative**: The United Nations aims to ensure that every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems within five years. The EW4All initiative is built on four pillars: disaster risk knowledge, detection and forecasting, warning dissemination and communication, and preparedness and response capabilities. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) leads the implementation of Pillar 2, focusing on detection, observation, monitoring, analysis, and forecasting.\n- **Regional and National Implementations**: Various regional and national workshops are being held to launch the EW4All initiative, including events in Central America, the Caribbean, Fiji, Ecuador, Tonga, Somalia, Seychelles, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and South Africa. These workshops aim to strengthen early warning systems and enhance disaster risk management in these regions.\n\n### International Collaborations\n\n- **ASEAN Climate Outlook Forum**: The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Climate Outlook Forum (ASEANCOF) provides collaboratively developed and consensus-based seasonal climate outlooks and related information on a regional scale. The forum focuses on agriculture and climate services, with a particular emphasis on drought.\n- **Asia-Pacific Partnership on Disaster Risk Reduction**: Regional Pillar leads are strategizing on the implementation of EW4All in the Asia-Pacific region, with discussions on the draft of the new Asia-Pacific Action Plan on DRR 2024-2027 and the first Regional EW4All Multi-Stakeholder Forum scheduled for October 2024 in Manila, Philippines.\n\nThese advancements highlight the expanding opportunities for AI and multi-hazard early warning systems to enhance forecasting, monitoring, and response strategies for existential threats.\n\nReferences:\n- <https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/disruptive-technologies/>\n- <https://wmo.int/activities/early-warnings-all/wmo-and-early-warnings-all-initiative>\n- <https://www.preventionweb.net/news/early-warnings-all-intiative-ew4all-june-2024-updates>\n## Question: What is the consensus among futurists and long-term thinkers about the likelihood of the world ending by 2100?\n  Answer: Error encountered in generating answer\n\n# FORECASTS\n## Reasoning from forecaster 0\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - According to [forum.effectivealtruism.org](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/frYYAAa5K4nHqRCPG/current-estimates-for-likelihood-of-x-risk), the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) conducted a casual survey in 2008 that estimated a 19% chance of human extinction by 2100.\n  - In the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament, the median domain expert predicted a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100.\n  - According to [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/578/human-extinction-by-2100/), superforecasters suggested a 9% probability of a catastrophic event and a 1% chance of extinction by 2100.\n  - Metaculus questions resolve positively 41% of the time, so there is a 41% base rate.\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.06\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: The most appropriate base rate is 6% from the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament because it is derived from aggregated expert opinion specifically focused on existential risks by 2100.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - There are significant existential risks identified, including supervolcanic eruptions, artificial intelligence, nuclear war, climate change, and engineered pathogens.\n  - Predictions about existential risks have become more formalized and are being actively studied by organizations like the Global Priorities Institute and the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk.\n\n**Cons**: \n  - Global efforts are in place to mitigate existential risks, including regulation of weapons, AI safety initiatives, climate change mitigation, and existential risk research.\n  - Humanity has shown resilience and the ability to adapt to extreme conditions, developing technologies and strategies to mitigate risks.\n  - Historical precedents show that past predictions about the end of the world have consistently been inaccurate, such as the 2012 Maya Apocalypse and Y2K.\n\n**Reasoning**: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 6% from the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament. Considering that there are significant existential risks identified and studied, I will make a small upward adjustment of 1% to account for these risks. However, given the robustness of global mitigation strategies, historical resilience, and the inaccuracy of past doomsday predictions, I will make a downward adjustment of 2%. Combining these adjustments, the final prediction is 5%.\n\n**Prediction**: 5.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 1\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - Metaculus questions resolve positively 41% of the time, so there is a 41% base rate\n  - The Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) conducted a casual survey in 2008 estimating a 19% chance of human extinction by 2100\n  - Superforecasters suggested a 1% chance of extinction by 2100\n  - A group of experts in the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament projected a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.06\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 6% from the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament because it directly addresses the likelihood of human extinction by 2100 and aggregates expert opinion.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - Advancements in AI safety and global cooperation efforts could mitigate existential risks.\n  - International agreements and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can help slow down global warming.\n  - Existential risk awareness is increasing, with more funding and research dedicated to understanding and mitigating these risks.\n\n**Cons**: \n  - Historical precedents for global catastrophic events demonstrate the potential for natural disasters to have catastrophic consequences on a global scale.\n  - Increased nuclear arsenals and geopolitical tensions heighten the risk of nuclear conflict.\n  - Climate change projections indicate significant impacts by 2100, including a potential 3.6\u00b0C global temperature increase.\n  - Misaligned AI and biotechnology risks, such as engineered pathogens, pose significant existential threats.\n\n**Reasoning**: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 6% from the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament. Considering the advancements in AI safety and global cooperation efforts which could mitigate existential risks, I will adjust down by 1% to 5%. However, the increased nuclear arsenals, geopolitical tensions, significant climate change projections, and risks from misaligned AI and biotechnology are strong factors that justify reverting to the base rate of 6%. Together, these factors suggest maintaining the original base rate, given the balance between mitigation efforts and persistent existential threats.\n\n**Prediction**: 6.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 2\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - Metaculus questions resolve positively 41% of the time, so there is a 41% base rate\n  - A group of superforecasters and experts projected a 6% likelihood of human extinction by 2100 in the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament (https://forecastingresearch.org/news/results-from-the-2022-existential-risk-persuasion-tournament)\n  - Historical base rate of global catastrophic events killing 1% of the global population within a decade is approximately 7.33% since 1500 (11 events / 524 years) (https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/base-rates-of-catastrophes/)\n  - The Future of Humanity Institute estimated a 19% chance of human extinction by 2100 (https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/frYYAAa5K4nHqRCPG/current-estimates-for-likelihood-of-x-risk)\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.06\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: The most appropriate base rate is 6% from the superforecasters' and experts' projection in the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament as it directly addresses the likelihood of human extinction by 2100 and is based on aggregated expert opinion.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - Advancements in existential risk mitigation strategies, like AI safety regulations and climate change mitigation efforts, are being actively pursued.\n  - Organizations like the Global Priorities Institute and the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk are increasing awareness and research on existential risks.\n  - Humanity's ability to adapt to extreme conditions with advanced technological strategies and infrastructure improvements.\n\n**Cons**: \n  - Increasing geopolitical tensions and nuclear proliferation could heighten the risk of nuclear warfare.\n  - Rapid advancements in AI and biotechnology pose significant risks if not properly regulated.\n  - Climate change impacts are becoming more severe and could lead to catastrophic consequences if not addressed effectively.\n\n**Reasoning**: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 6% from the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament. Advancements in mitigation strategies and increased awareness can reduce the risk slightly, so I'll adjust down by 1% to 5%. However, significant cons such as increasing geopolitical tensions, rapid AI and biotech advancements, and severe climate change impacts counterbalance this, so I'll adjust back up by 1% to 6%. Given that no aggregated prediction markets or consensus forecasts provide additional strong evidence, I'll keep the final prediction close to the chosen base rate.\n\n**Prediction**: 6.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 3\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - The Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) conducted a casual survey in 2008, estimating a 19% chance of human extinction by 2100.\n  - Experts participating in the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament gave a 6% likelihood of human extinction by 2100.\n  - Superforecasters in the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament suggested a 1% chance of human extinction by 2100.\n  - Metaculus questions resolve positively 41% of the time, so there is a 41% base rate\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.06\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: Given the severity of the question, the base rates from the Future of Humanity Institute survey and the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament are more appropriate as they directly address existential risks and human extinction likelihood. The chosen base rate of 6% from the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament appears to be the most moderate and well-supported by expert opinion.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - Several major existential risks are identified, including AI, nuclear war, climate change, and engineered pathogens.\n  - Experts are increasingly aware and focused on studying and mitigating existential risks.\n  - Advancements in global monitoring and early warning systems, like AI-driven forecasting and the EW4All initiative, are improving our ability to respond to existential threats.\n\n**Cons**: \n  - Historical precedents for predicting the end of the world (e.g., Y2K, 2012 Mayan calendar) have been consistently inaccurate.\n  - Global cooperation on mitigating existential risks faces significant challenges and is often insufficient.\n  - Technological advancements could exacerbate existential risks if not managed wisely.\n  - Climate change projections indicate significant impacts, but not necessarily human extinction by 2100.\n  - Experts and superforecasters' estimates for human extinction by 2100 remain relatively low (1% to 6%).\n\n**Reasoning**: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 6%. The pros suggest that awareness and efforts toward mitigating existential risks are increasing, but the cons highlight the significant challenges and historical inaccuracy of such predictions. Given that the aggregated information did not provide additional insights, and the estimates remain low, I will only make small adjustments. Considering the increasing focus on mitigation but acknowledging that these efforts might still fall short, I will adjust down by a small margin to reflect the overall low perceived likelihood among experts.\n\n**Prediction**: 5.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 4\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - Metaculus questions resolve positively 41% of the time, so there is a 41% base rate\n  - A 2008 survey by the Future of Humanity Institute estimated a 19% chance of human extinction by 2100\n  - The Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament had a median expert projection of a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100\n  - Superforecasters from the same tournament suggested a 1% chance of human extinction by 2100\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.06\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is the 6% chance from the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament median expert projection because it aggregates the opinions of domain experts specifically on human extinction, providing a relevant and informed base rate.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: Superforecasters suggested a 1% chance of extinction by 2100 in the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament\n\n**Pros**:\n  - Advancements in AI Safety and regulatory efforts could mitigate AI-related existential risks\n  - Global cooperation and climate change mitigation strategies are being implemented to address climate change\n  - Existential risk awareness and engagement by experts and institutions\n\n**Cons**: \n  - Significant historical precedents for global catastrophic events such as supervolcanic eruptions and pandemics\n  - Current trends in nuclear proliferation and geopolitical instability\n  - Unregulated AI development poses significant existential risks\n  - Climate change impacts are projected to be severe by 2100\n\n**Reasoning**: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 6%. Superforecasters' aggregated information suggests a lower probability (1%), which indicates a more optimistic view from highly accurate predictors, so I'll adjust downwards by 2% to 4%. Pros and cons provide a mixed outlook: advancements in AI safety and climate change mitigation are positive, but significant existential risks remain. Given the balance of these factors, I will keep the adjustment modest. Therefore, I will adjust upwards slightly by 1% to account for ongoing mitigation efforts, resulting in a final prediction of 5%.\n\n**Prediction**: 5.0%\n\n\n",

Examples include the Toba Caldera eruption 74,000 years ago and the Taupo Volcanic Zone eruption 26,500 years ago.\n\n2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The development of superintelligent AI poses significant risks if it becomes uncontrollable or misaligned with human values. This could lead to catastrophic consequences, including human extinction.\n\n3. **Nuclear War**: The use of nuclear weapons on a large scale could cause a global nuclear winter, leading to significant loss of life and potentially even human extinction.\n\n4. **Climate Change**: While climate change is often viewed as a gradual process, its cumulative effects could lead to catastrophic consequences, including sea-level rise, droughts, and extreme weather events, which could ultimately threaten human civilization.\n\n5. **Engineered Pathogens**: The creation and release of highly infectious and deadly pathogens could lead to global pandemics, potentially causing significant loss of life and even human extinction.\n\nThese risks are recognized by experts and superforecasters alike, and their likelihood and potential impact are being studied and debated in various forums and research initiatives.\n\nReferences:\n- https://globaia.org/risks\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23785731/human-extinction-forecasting-superforecasters\n- https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/un42vaZgyX7ch2kaj/announcing-forecasting-existential-risks-evidence-from-a\n## Question: How have predictions about existential risks changed over recent decades?\n  Answer: Predictions about existential risks have undergone significant changes over recent decades, reflecting advancements in scientific understanding and the increasing awareness of potential threats to humanity. Here are some key developments:\n\n1. **Early Recognition**: The concept of existential risks dates back to the 18th-century Enlightenment, when scientists began to consider the possibility of human extinction due to various catastrophes.\n\n2. **Supervolcanic Eruptions**: The threat of supervolcanic eruptions has been recognized as a significant existential risk. These events, such as the Toba eruption 74,000 years ago, can cause global cooling, disrupt agriculture, and lead to long-term climate change.\n\n3. **Climate Change**: Climate change has become a prominent existential risk, with many experts labeling it an \"existential threat.\" This threat is not only to human existence but also to our ways of life and cultural heritage. If left unchecked, climate change could lead to mass extinctions and significant disruptions to human societies.\n\n4. **Increased Awareness**: The study of existential risks has become more formalized, with the establishment of organizations like the Global Priorities Institute and the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk. These organizations focus on understanding and mitigating these risks.\n\n5. **Shift in Focus**: While earlier predictions focused on the literal extinction of humanity, more recent discussions have expanded to include the erosion of human cultures, traditions, and languages. This broader perspective acknowledges that even if humanity survives, the consequences of climate change and other risks can still have devastating impacts on our societies and ways of life.\n\n6. **Adaptation and Resilience**: There is a growing recognition of humanity's ability to adapt to extreme conditions. This includes the development of technological strategies, such as floating cities, and the need for infrastructure that can support large populations in a changing climate.\n\nIn summary, predictions about existential risks have evolved to encompass a wider range of threats, including supervolcanic eruptions and climate change. The focus has shifted from solely considering human extinction to also addressing the broader impacts on human societies and cultures.\n\nReferences:\n- https://globaia.org/risks\n- https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/why-do-some-people-call-climate-change-existential-threat\n- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001632871930357X\n- https://michigantoday.umich.edu/2021/06/25/will-the-earth-be-habitable-in-2100/\n## Question: How often have experts revised their predictions about existential risks?\n  Answer: Experts have revised their predictions about existential risks through iterative updates during the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament (XPT). The XPT involved a collaborative approach where participants, including experts and superforecasters, engaged in predicting future events and updating their views iteratively. This process allowed for the exchange of information and the refinement of forecasts over time.\n\nIn the XPT, experts and superforecasters were incentivized to discuss their reasoning and update their forecasts, both individually and in teams. This iterative process facilitated the revision of predictions as participants considered diverse perspectives and new information.\n\nWhile the specific frequency of revisions is not explicitly stated, the XPT's methodology emphasizes the importance of iterative updates in refining predictions. This approach acknowledges that forecasting is an ongoing process that benefits from continuous refinement and adaptation to new information.\n\nReferences:\n- https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23785731/human-extinction-forecasting-superforecasters\n- https://forecastingresearch.org/xpt\n- https://www.freethink.com/robots-ai/ai-predictions-superforecasters\n## Question: What historical precedents exist for global catastrophic events?\n  Answer: Historical precedents for global catastrophic events include several significant natural disasters and environmental crises that have had devastating impacts on human populations and the environment.

None of these events occurred.\n\n2. **Harold Camping**: Harold Camping, a prolific predictor of end times, made multiple predictions, including one for May 21, 2011, and another for October 21, 2011. Both dates passed without incident.\n\n3. **True Way**: Taiwanese religious leader Hon-Ming Chen predicted that God would appear on U.S. television channel 18 on March 25, 1988, and that millions of devil spirits would cause a mass extinction of the human population in the following year. These predictions did not materialize.\n\n4. **Halley\u2019s Comet Panic**: In 1910, the approach of Halley\u2019s comet led to fears that it would destroy the planet. This prediction was also incorrect.\n\n5. **Millerism**: William Miller predicted the end of the world in 1843 and then recalculated to 1844. Both predictions failed to come true.\n\n6. **Joanna Southcott**: Joanna Southcott predicted that she would give birth to the second messiah in 1814, signaling the end of the world. She died before this could happen.\n\n7. **The Prophet Hen of Leeds**: A hen in Leeds, England, was believed to have laid eggs with the message \"Christ is coming.\" This was later discovered to be a hoax.\n\n8. **Earth Day Predictions**: Around the first Earth Day in 1970, several predictions were made about the imminent end of the world due to environmental disasters. These predictions, including those by George Wald, Barry Commoner, and Paul Ehrlich, were spectacularly wrong.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that past predictions about the end of the world have been consistently inaccurate. This information can help inform predictions about the likelihood of the world ending by 2100.\n\nReferences:\n- https://www.britannica.com/list/10-failed-doomsday-predictions\n- https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/18-spectacularly-wrong-predictions-were-made-around-the-time-of-the-first-earth-day-in-1970-expect-more-this-year/\n## Question: What is the role of human behavior and decision-making in mitigating or exacerbating existential risks?\n  Answer: The role of human behavior and decision-making in mitigating or exacerbating existential risks is crucial in determining whether the world will end by 2100. Human behavior and decision-making can significantly impact the likelihood and severity of existential risks, which include threats such as climate change, nuclear war, and pandemics.\n\n### Mitigating Existential Risks\n\n1. **Ecological Footprint Analysis**: Professor William Rees, the originator of ecological footprint analysis, emphasizes the need for a dynamic, equitable steady-state economy to satisfy basic human needs and mitigate environmental degradation.\n\n2. **Futures Thinking**: Iker, in his article on the future of work, highlights the importance of futures thinking in identifying and building desirable futures. This approach encourages proactive decision-making to steer reality towards a more sustainable and humane direction.\n\n3. **Existential Risk Reduction**: The astronomical value thesis suggests that reducing existential risk can have immense value. However, this requires abandoning pessimism and adopting a more optimistic view of humanity's ability to manage risks effectively. This can be achieved by establishing institutions dedicated to preventing existential risks and fostering a culture of wisdom and responsible technology management.\n\n### Exacerbating Existential Risks\n\n1. **Pessimism and Risk Perception**: Research on the psychology of existential risk indicates that people often underestimate the long-term consequences of catastrophes. This neglect can lead to a lack of urgency in addressing these risks, thereby exacerbating them.\n\n2. **Technological Risks**: The development of new technologies can pose unprecedented destructive capabilities, increasing existential risks if not managed wisely. Pessimists argue that humanity's technological capabilities are growing faster than our wisdom to handle them, making it essential to prioritize wisdom and risk management.\n\nIn conclusion, human behavior and decision-making play a critical role in mitigating or exacerbating existential risks. By adopting a proactive, futures-thinking approach and prioritizing wisdom and risk management, humanity can reduce the likelihood of existential risks and create a more sustainable future.\n\nReferences:\n- https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/the-way-forward-survival-2100\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-50145-9\n- https://humanefutureofwork.com/what-will-the-world-be-like-in-2100/\n- https://philarchive.org/archive/THOHRL\n## Question: What are the latest advancements in global monitoring and early warning systems for existential threats?\n  Answer: The latest advancements in global monitoring and early warning systems for existential threats include significant developments in artificial intelligence (AI), multi-hazard early warning systems, and international collaborations to enhance forecasting and response strategies.\n\n### Artificial Intelligence (AI) Advancements\n\n- **Generative AI**: Recent dramatic advances in generative AI have sparked debate about its potential existential risks. While some experts argue that these risks are highly speculative, others highlight the potential for AI to accelerate information corruption and deformation, which could hinder effective responses to urgent threats like nuclear war, pandemics, and climate change.\n- **AI in Early Warning Systems**: AI is rapidly transforming early warning systems, offering significant advancements in disaster risk management. Examples include Google's global flood forecasting initiative, Microsoft's work on exposure data in Ethiopia, and Everbridge's innovative communication solutions. These developments aim to make early warning systems more accessible and effective across different regions and challenges.\n\n### Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems\n\n- **Early Warnings for All (EW4All) Initiative**: The United Nations aims to ensure that every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems within five years. The EW4All initiative is built on four pillars: disaster risk knowledge, detection and forecasting, warning dissemination and communication, and preparedness and response capabilities. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) leads the implementation of Pillar 2, focusing on detection, observation, monitoring, analysis, and forecasting.\n- **Regional and National Implementations**: Various regional and national workshops are being held to launch the EW4All initiative, including events in Central America, the Caribbean, Fiji, Ecuador, Tonga, Somalia, Seychelles, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and South Africa. These workshops aim to strengthen early warning systems and enhance disaster risk management in these regions.\n\n### International Collaborations\n\n- **ASEAN Climate Outlook Forum**: The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Climate Outlook Forum (ASEANCOF) provides collaboratively developed and consensus-based seasonal climate outlooks and related information on a regional scale. The forum focuses on agriculture and climate services, with a particular emphasis on drought.\n- **Asia-Pacific Partnership on Disaster Risk Reduction**: Regional Pillar leads are strategizing on the implementation of EW4All in the Asia-Pacific region, with discussions on the draft of the new Asia-Pacific Action Plan on DRR 2024-2027 and the first Regional EW4All Multi-Stakeholder Forum scheduled for October 2024 in Manila, Philippines.\n\nThese advancements highlight the expanding opportunities for AI and multi-hazard early warning systems to enhance forecasting, monitoring, and response strategies for existential threats.\n\nReferences:\n- <https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/disruptive-technologies/>\n- <https://wmo.int/activities/early-warnings-all/wmo-and-early-warnings-all-initiative>\n- <https://www.preventionweb.net/news/early-warnings-all-intiative-ew4all-june-2024-updates>\n## Question: What is the consensus among futurists and long-term thinkers about the likelihood of the world ending by 2100?\n  Answer: Error encountered in generating answer\n\n# Final Instructions\nGive a forecast on the question above following the below steps.

Examples include the Toba Caldera eruption 74,000 years ago and the Taupo Volcanic Zone eruption 26,500 years ago.\n\n2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The development of superintelligent AI poses significant risks if it becomes uncontrollable or misaligned with human values. This could lead to catastrophic consequences, including human extinction.\n\n3. **Nuclear War**: The use of nuclear weapons on a large scale could cause a global nuclear winter, leading to significant loss of life and potentially even human extinction.\n\n4. **Climate Change**: While climate change is often viewed as a gradual process, its cumulative effects could lead to catastrophic consequences, including sea-level rise, droughts, and extreme weather events, which could ultimately threaten human civilization.\n\n5. **Engineered Pathogens**: The creation and release of highly infectious and deadly pathogens could lead to global pandemics, potentially causing significant loss of life and even human extinction.\n\nThese risks are recognized by experts and superforecasters alike, and their likelihood and potential impact are being studied and debated in various forums and research initiatives.\n\nReferences:\n- https://globaia.org/risks\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23785731/human-extinction-forecasting-superforecasters\n- https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/un42vaZgyX7ch2kaj/announcing-forecasting-existential-risks-evidence-from-a\n## Question: How have predictions about existential risks changed over recent decades?\n  Answer: Predictions about existential risks have undergone significant changes over recent decades, reflecting advancements in scientific understanding and the increasing awareness of potential threats to humanity. Here are some key developments:\n\n1. **Early Recognition**: The concept of existential risks dates back to the 18th-century Enlightenment, when scientists began to consider the possibility of human extinction due to various catastrophes.\n\n2. **Supervolcanic Eruptions**: The threat of supervolcanic eruptions has been recognized as a significant existential risk. These events, such as the Toba eruption 74,000 years ago, can cause global cooling, disrupt agriculture, and lead to long-term climate change.\n\n3. **Climate Change**: Climate change has become a prominent existential risk, with many experts labeling it an \"existential threat.\" This threat is not only to human existence but also to our ways of life and cultural heritage. If left unchecked, climate change could lead to mass extinctions and significant disruptions to human societies.\n\n4. **Increased Awareness**: The study of existential risks has become more formalized, with the establishment of organizations like the Global Priorities Institute and the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk. These organizations focus on understanding and mitigating these risks.\n\n5. **Shift in Focus**: While earlier predictions focused on the literal extinction of humanity, more recent discussions have expanded to include the erosion of human cultures, traditions, and languages. This broader perspective acknowledges that even if humanity survives, the consequences of climate change and other risks can still have devastating impacts on our societies and ways of life.\n\n6. **Adaptation and Resilience**: There is a growing recognition of humanity's ability to adapt to extreme conditions. This includes the development of technological strategies, such as floating cities, and the need for infrastructure that can support large populations in a changing climate.\n\nIn summary, predictions about existential risks have evolved to encompass a wider range of threats, including supervolcanic eruptions and climate change. The focus has shifted from solely considering human extinction to also addressing the broader impacts on human societies and cultures.\n\nReferences:\n- https://globaia.org/risks\n- https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/why-do-some-people-call-climate-change-existential-threat\n- https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S001632871930357X\n- https://michigantoday.umich.edu/2021/06/25/will-the-earth-be-habitable-in-2100/\n## Question: How often have experts revised their predictions about existential risks?\n  Answer: Experts have revised their predictions about existential risks through iterative updates during the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament (XPT). The XPT involved a collaborative approach where participants, including experts and superforecasters, engaged in predicting future events and updating their views iteratively. This process allowed for the exchange of information and the refinement of forecasts over time.\n\nIn the XPT, experts and superforecasters were incentivized to discuss their reasoning and update their forecasts, both individually and in teams. This iterative process facilitated the revision of predictions as participants considered diverse perspectives and new information.\n\nWhile the specific frequency of revisions is not explicitly stated, the XPT's methodology emphasizes the importance of iterative updates in refining predictions. This approach acknowledges that forecasting is an ongoing process that benefits from continuous refinement and adaptation to new information.\n\nReferences:\n- https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23785731/human-extinction-forecasting-superforecasters\n- https://forecastingresearch.org/xpt\n- https://www.freethink.com/robots-ai/ai-predictions-superforecasters\n## Question: What historical precedents exist for global catastrophic events?\n  Answer: Historical precedents for global catastrophic events include several significant natural disasters and environmental crises that have had devastating impacts on human populations and the environment. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Mount Tambora Eruption (1815)**: This volcanic eruption in Indonesia is considered the largest in recorded history, causing widespread destruction and a global climate anomaly known as the \"Year Without a Summer\" in 1816.\n\n2. **1931 China Floods**: Heavy rainfall in Central China led to massive flooding along the Yangzi, Huai, and Yellow rivers, resulting in an estimated death toll of up to 4 million people.\n\n3. **2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami**: A magnitude 9.1 earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that affected several countries in Southeast Asia, causing approximately 227,000 deaths and significant economic damage.\n\n4. **2023 Turkey-Syria Earthquake**: A magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck south-central Turkey, causing widespread destruction and over 50,000 confirmed deaths in Turkey and Syria.\n\nThese historical events demonstrate the potential for natural disasters to have catastrophic consequences on a global scale. Understanding these precedents can inform predictions about the likelihood and potential impacts of future global catastrophic events.\n\nReferences:\n- https://www.livescience.com/biggest-natural-disasters-throughout-history\n- https://www.directrelief.org/2019/12/10-disasters-that-changed-the-world/\n## Question: What mitigation strategies are currently in place to address existential risks?\n  Answer: To address existential risks, several mitigation strategies are currently in place or being proposed:\n\n1. **Regulation of Chemical and Biological Weapons**: Efforts to regulate these weapons aim to reduce the risk of global catastrophes.

Human behavior and decision-making can significantly impact the likelihood and severity of existential risks, which include threats such as climate change, nuclear war, and pandemics.\n\n### Mitigating Existential Risks\n\n1. **Ecological Footprint Analysis**: Professor William Rees, the originator of ecological footprint analysis, emphasizes the need for a dynamic, equitable steady-state economy to satisfy basic human needs and mitigate environmental degradation.\n\n2. **Futures Thinking**: Iker, in his article on the future of work, highlights the importance of futures thinking in identifying and building desirable futures. This approach encourages proactive decision-making to steer reality towards a more sustainable and humane direction.\n\n3. **Existential Risk Reduction**: The astronomical value thesis suggests that reducing existential risk can have immense value. However, this requires abandoning pessimism and adopting a more optimistic view of humanity's ability to manage risks effectively. This can be achieved by establishing institutions dedicated to preventing existential risks and fostering a culture of wisdom and responsible technology management.\n\n### Exacerbating Existential Risks\n\n1. **Pessimism and Risk Perception**: Research on the psychology of existential risk indicates that people often underestimate the long-term consequences of catastrophes. This neglect can lead to a lack of urgency in addressing these risks, thereby exacerbating them.\n\n2. **Technological Risks**: The development of new technologies can pose unprecedented destructive capabilities, increasing existential risks if not managed wisely. Pessimists argue that humanity's technological capabilities are growing faster than our wisdom to handle them, making it essential to prioritize wisdom and risk management.\n\nIn conclusion, human behavior and decision-making play a critical role in mitigating or exacerbating existential risks. By adopting a proactive, futures-thinking approach and prioritizing wisdom and risk management, humanity can reduce the likelihood of existential risks and create a more sustainable future.\n\nReferences:\n- https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/the-way-forward-survival-2100\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-50145-9\n- https://humanefutureofwork.com/what-will-the-world-be-like-in-2100/\n- https://philarchive.org/archive/THOHRL\n## Question: What are the latest advancements in global monitoring and early warning systems for existential threats?\n  Answer: The latest advancements in global monitoring and early warning systems for existential threats include significant developments in artificial intelligence (AI), multi-hazard early warning systems, and international collaborations to enhance forecasting and response strategies.\n\n### Artificial Intelligence (AI) Advancements\n\n- **Generative AI**: Recent dramatic advances in generative AI have sparked debate about its potential existential risks. While some experts argue that these risks are highly speculative, others highlight the potential for AI to accelerate information corruption and deformation, which could hinder effective responses to urgent threats like nuclear war, pandemics, and climate change.\n- **AI in Early Warning Systems**: AI is rapidly transforming early warning systems, offering significant advancements in disaster risk management. Examples include Google's global flood forecasting initiative, Microsoft's work on exposure data in Ethiopia, and Everbridge's innovative communication solutions. These developments aim to make early warning systems more accessible and effective across different regions and challenges.\n\n### Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems\n\n- **Early Warnings for All (EW4All) Initiative**: The United Nations aims to ensure that every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems within five years. The EW4All initiative is built on four pillars: disaster risk knowledge, detection and forecasting, warning dissemination and communication, and preparedness and response capabilities. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) leads the implementation of Pillar 2, focusing on detection, observation, monitoring, analysis, and forecasting.\n- **Regional and National Implementations**: Various regional and national workshops are being held to launch the EW4All initiative, including events in Central America, the Caribbean, Fiji, Ecuador, Tonga, Somalia, Seychelles, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and South Africa. These workshops aim to strengthen early warning systems and enhance disaster risk management in these regions.\n\n### International Collaborations\n\n- **ASEAN Climate Outlook Forum**: The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Climate Outlook Forum (ASEANCOF) provides collaboratively developed and consensus-based seasonal climate outlooks and related information on a regional scale. The forum focuses on agriculture and climate services, with a particular emphasis on drought.\n- **Asia-Pacific Partnership on Disaster Risk Reduction**: Regional Pillar leads are strategizing on the implementation of EW4All in the Asia-Pacific region, with discussions on the draft of the new Asia-Pacific Action Plan on DRR 2024-2027 and the first Regional EW4All Multi-Stakeholder Forum scheduled for October 2024 in Manila, Philippines.\n\nThese advancements highlight the expanding opportunities for AI and multi-hazard early warning systems to enhance forecasting, monitoring, and response strategies for existential threats.\n\nReferences:\n- <https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/disruptive-technologies/>\n- <https://wmo.int/activities/early-warnings-all/wmo-and-early-warnings-all-initiative>\n- <https://www.preventionweb.net/news/early-warnings-all-intiative-ew4all-june-2024-updates>\n## Question: What is the consensus among futurists and long-term thinkers about the likelihood of the world ending by 2100?\n  Answer: Error encountered in generating answer\n\n# FORECASTS\n## Reasoning from forecaster 0\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - According to [forum.effectivealtruism.org](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/frYYAAa5K4nHqRCPG/current-estimates-for-likelihood-of-x-risk), the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) conducted a casual survey in 2008 that estimated a 19% chance of human extinction by 2100.\n  - In the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament, the median domain expert predicted a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100.\n  - According to [Metaculus](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/578/human-extinction-by-2100/), superforecasters suggested a 9% probability of a catastrophic event and a 1% chance of extinction by 2100.\n  - Metaculus questions resolve positively 41% of the time, so there is a 41% base rate.\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.06\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: The most appropriate base rate is 6% from the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament because it is derived from aggregated expert opinion specifically focused on existential risks by 2100.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - There are significant existential risks identified, including supervolcanic eruptions, artificial intelligence, nuclear war, climate change, and engineered pathogens.\n  - Predictions about existential risks have become more formalized and are being actively studied by organizations like the Global Priorities Institute and the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk.\n\n**Cons**: \n  - Global efforts are in place to mitigate existential risks, including regulation of weapons, AI safety initiatives, climate change mitigation, and existential risk research.\n  - Humanity has shown resilience and the ability to adapt to extreme conditions, developing technologies and strategies to mitigate risks.\n  - Historical precedents show that past predictions about the end of the world have consistently been inaccurate, such as the 2012 Maya Apocalypse and Y2K.\n\n**Reasoning**: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 6% from the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament. Considering that there are significant existential risks identified and studied, I will make a small upward adjustment of 1% to account for these risks. However, given the robustness of global mitigation strategies, historical resilience, and the inaccuracy of past doomsday predictions, I will make a downward adjustment of 2%. Combining these adjustments, the final prediction is 5%.\n\n**Prediction**: 5.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 1\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - Metaculus questions resolve positively 41% of the time, so there is a 41% base rate\n  - The Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) conducted a casual survey in 2008 estimating a 19% chance of human extinction by 2100\n  - Superforecasters suggested a 1% chance of extinction by 2100\n  - A group of experts in the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament projected a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.06\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 6% from the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament because it directly addresses the likelihood of human extinction by 2100 and aggregates expert opinion.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - Advancements in AI safety and global cooperation efforts could mitigate existential risks.\n  - International agreements and efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can help slow down global warming.\n  - Existential risk awareness is increasing, with more funding and research dedicated to understanding and mitigating these risks.\n\n**Cons**: \n  - Historical precedents for global catastrophic events demonstrate the potential for natural disasters to have catastrophic consequences on a global scale.\n  - Increased nuclear arsenals and geopolitical tensions heighten the risk of nuclear conflict.\n  - Climate change projections indicate significant impacts by 2100, including a potential 3.6\u00b0C global temperature increase.\n  - Misaligned AI and biotechnology risks, such as engineered pathogens, pose significant existential threats.\n\n**Reasoning**: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 6% from the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament. Considering the advancements in AI safety and global cooperation efforts which could mitigate existential risks, I will adjust down by 1% to 5%. However, the increased nuclear arsenals, geopolitical tensions, significant climate change projections, and risks from misaligned AI and biotechnology are strong factors that justify reverting to the base rate of 6%. Together, these factors suggest maintaining the original base rate, given the balance between mitigation efforts and persistent existential threats.\n\n**Prediction**: 6.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 2\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - Metaculus questions resolve positively 41% of the time, so there is a 41% base rate\n  - A group of superforecasters and experts projected a 6% likelihood of human extinction by 2100 in the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament (https://forecastingresearch.org/news/results-from-the-2022-existential-risk-persuasion-tournament)\n  - Historical base rate of global catastrophic events killing 1% of the global population within a decade is approximately 7.33% since 1500 (11 events / 524 years) (https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/base-rates-of-catastrophes/)\n  - The Future of Humanity Institute estimated a 19% chance of human extinction by 2100 (https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/frYYAAa5K4nHqRCPG/current-estimates-for-likelihood-of-x-risk)\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.06\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: The most appropriate base rate is 6% from the superforecasters' and experts' projection in the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament as it directly addresses the likelihood of human extinction by 2100 and is based on aggregated expert opinion.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - Advancements in existential risk mitigation strategies, like AI safety regulations and climate change mitigation efforts, are being actively pursued.\n  - Organizations like the Global Priorities Institute and the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk are increasing awareness and research on existential risks.\n  - Humanity's ability to adapt to extreme conditions with advanced technological strategies and infrastructure improvements.\n\n**Cons**: \n  - Increasing geopolitical tensions and nuclear proliferation could heighten the risk of nuclear warfare.\n  - Rapid advancements in AI and biotechnology pose significant risks if not properly regulated.\n  - Climate change impacts are becoming more severe and could lead to catastrophic consequences if not addressed effectively.\n\n**Reasoning**: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 6% from the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament. Advancements in mitigation strategies and increased awareness can reduce the risk slightly, so I'll adjust down by 1% to 5%. However, significant cons such as increasing geopolitical tensions, rapid AI and biotech advancements, and severe climate change impacts counterbalance this, so I'll adjust back up by 1% to 6%. Given that no aggregated prediction markets or consensus forecasts provide additional strong evidence, I'll keep the final prediction close to the chosen base rate.\n\n**Prediction**: 6.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 3\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - The Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) conducted a casual survey in 2008, estimating a 19% chance of human extinction by 2100.\n  - Experts participating in the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament gave a 6% likelihood of human extinction by 2100.\n  - Superforecasters in the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament suggested a 1% chance of human extinction by 2100.\n  - Metaculus questions resolve positively 41% of the time, so there is a 41% base rate\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.06\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: Given the severity of the question, the base rates from the Future of Humanity Institute survey and the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament are more appropriate as they directly address existential risks and human extinction likelihood. The chosen base rate of 6% from the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament appears to be the most moderate and well-supported by expert opinion.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - Several major existential risks are identified, including AI, nuclear war, climate change, and engineered pathogens.\n  - Experts are increasingly aware and focused on studying and mitigating existential risks.\n  - Advancements in global monitoring and early warning systems, like AI-driven forecasting and the EW4All initiative, are improving our ability to respond to existential threats.\n\n**Cons**: \n  - Historical precedents for predicting the end of the world (e.g., Y2K, 2012 Mayan calendar) have been consistently inaccurate.\n  - Global cooperation on mitigating existential risks faces significant challenges and is often insufficient.\n  - Technological advancements could exacerbate existential risks if not managed wisely.\n  - Climate change projections indicate significant impacts, but not necessarily human extinction by 2100.\n  - Experts and superforecasters' estimates for human extinction by 2100 remain relatively low (1% to 6%).\n\n**Reasoning**: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 6%. The pros suggest that awareness and efforts toward mitigating existential risks are increasing, but the cons highlight the significant challenges and historical inaccuracy of such predictions. Given that the aggregated information did not provide additional insights, and the estimates remain low, I will only make small adjustments. Considering the increasing focus on mitigation but acknowledging that these efforts might still fall short, I will adjust down by a small margin to reflect the overall low perceived likelihood among experts.\n\n**Prediction**: 5.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 4\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - Metaculus questions resolve positively 41% of the time, so there is a 41% base rate\n  - A 2008 survey by the Future of Humanity Institute estimated a 19% chance of human extinction by 2100\n  - The Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament had a median expert projection of a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100\n  - Superforecasters from the same tournament suggested a 1% chance of human extinction by 2100\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.06\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is the 6% chance from the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament median expert projection because it aggregates the opinions of domain experts specifically on human extinction, providing a relevant and informed base rate.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: Superforecasters suggested a 1% chance of extinction by 2100 in the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament\n\n**Pros**:\n  - Advancements in AI Safety and regulatory efforts could mitigate AI-related existential risks\n  - Global cooperation and climate change mitigation strategies are being implemented to address climate change\n  - Existential risk awareness and engagement by experts and institutions\n\n**Cons**: \n  - Significant historical precedents for global catastrophic events such as supervolcanic eruptions and pandemics\n  - Current trends in nuclear proliferation and geopolitical instability\n  - Unregulated AI development poses significant existential risks\n  - Climate change impacts are projected to be severe by 2100\n\n**Reasoning**: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 6%. Superforecasters' aggregated information suggests a lower probability (1%), which indicates a more optimistic view from highly accurate predictors, so I'll adjust downwards by 2% to 4%. Pros and cons provide a mixed outlook: advancements in AI safety and climate change mitigation are positive, but significant existential risks remain. Given the balance of these factors, I will keep the adjustment modest. Therefore, I will adjust upwards slightly by 1% to account for ongoing mitigation efforts, resulting in a final prediction of 5%.\n\n**Prediction**: 5.0%\n\n\n\n",

The 6% chance of AI-related extinction and the risk of deliberate use of WMDs are significant existential threats, but they are already captured in the chosen base rate. The escalating conflicts and geopolitical instability also add weight to the positive resolution. However, the resilience of human societies as demonstrated by past events, advances in technology, and potential for space colonization should reduce the probability of extinction. Given the balanced nature of the pros and cons, I will make a slight downward adjustment to account for human resilience and technological advancements, adjusting the base rate down by 3% to 16% (0.16).\n\n**Prediction**: 16.0%\n\n\n\n# QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n## Question: What are the historical extinction rates of species on Earth?\n  Answer: Historical extinction rates of species on Earth have been significant and varied over time. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Mass Extinctions**: There have been five major mass extinctions in Earth's history, each resulting in the loss of a large number of species. These events occurred at the end of the Cretaceous (66 million years ago), Late Triassic (199 million years ago), End Permian (252 million years ago), Late Devonian (378 million years ago), and Late Ordovician (447 million years ago) periods.\n\n2. **Current Extinction Rate**: The current rate of species extinction is estimated to be up to 10,000 times higher than the natural, historical rate. This is largely driven by human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change.\n\n3. **Species at Risk**: At least 15,000 species are currently threatened with extinction, out of an estimated eight million species on Earth.\n\n4. **Recent Extinctions**: Since the end of the last ice age, many species have gone extinct due to climate changes and human activities such as overhunting and habitat destruction. Industrialization has further accelerated extinction rates.\n\nThese points highlight the significant impact of human activities on species extinction rates and the need for conservation efforts to mitigate these effects.\n\nSources:\n- https://naturalhistory.si.edu/education/teaching-resources/paleontology/extinction-over-time\n- https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/planet-earth/forests-and-deserts/species-extinction-rate\n## Question: How has the human population size and distribution changed over the last century?\n  Answer: To provide context for the larger question of whether the world will end by 2100, let's examine how the human population size and distribution have changed over the last century.\n\n### Population Growth and Distribution\n\n- **Population Size**: The global population has grown significantly over the last century. In 1800, there were approximately one billion people, and today there are over eight billion.\n- **Growth Rate**: The population growth rate peaked in the 1960s at over 2% per year and has since declined to less than 1%. The UN projects that this decline will continue until the end of the century, with negative growth (population shrinkage) expected towards the end of the century.\n- **Peak Child**: The number of children under the age of five has peaked and is expected to decline in the coming decades.\n- **Regional Distribution**: By 2100, more than 8 out of 10 people in the world will live in Asia or Africa.\n\n### Impact of Climate Change\n\n- **Sea Level Rise**: Rising sea levels will significantly alter coastlines, making many cities uninhabitable and displacing hundreds of millions of people. Cities like London, New York, Bangkok, and others will be at risk of flooding.\n- **Climate Migration**: Climate change will lead to increased migration, food shortages, and the spread of infectious diseases due to more frequent and long-lasting heatwaves.\n\n### Habitability and Adaptation\n\n- **Habitability**: Despite the challenges posed by climate change, the Earth will still be habitable in 2100. Humans have adapted to extreme environments and will continue to do so, but the planet's habitability will be affected by rising temperatures, sea level rise, and ecosystem changes.\n\n### Sources\n\n- https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth\n- https://www.earth.com/news/how-will-the-world-look-in-2100-due-to-climate-change/\n- https://michigantoday.umich.edu/2021/06/25/will-the-earth-be-habitable-in-2100/\n## Question: What are the primary existential risks currently identified by experts?\n  Answer: In the context of the larger question 'Will the world end by 2100?', the primary existential risks currently identified by experts include:\n\n1. **Supervolcanic Eruptions**: These rare events have the potential to cause catastrophic global consequences, including widespread destruction of ecosystems, disruption of global agriculture, and long-term climate change. The most recent supereruption on record occurred at Indonesia's Toba Caldera approximately 74,000 years ago, which likely triggered a volcanic winter and significantly reduced the global human population.\n\n2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Experts predict a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100 due to AI, while superforecasters put the odds at 1%. This risk is associated with the potential for AI to become uncontrollable and pose a threat to humanity.\n\n3. **Climate Change**: Climate change is considered an existential threat due to its potential to cause mass extinctions and disrupt human societies. Unchecked climate change could lead to global temperatures increasing by 4.5 degrees Celsius or more by 2100, which would have catastrophic consequences.\n\nThese risks are identified by experts in various fields, including volcanology, AI research, and climate science.\n\nSources:\n- https://globaia.org/risks\n- https://www.freethink.com/robots-ai/ai-predictions-superforecasters\n- https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/why-do-some-people-call-climate-change-existential-threat\n## Question: What probability do experts assign to existential risks such as nuclear war, climate change, pandemics, and artificial intelligence by 2100?\n  Answer: To provide a comprehensive answer to the question, I will break down the probabilities assigned to each of the mentioned existential risks by experts:\n\n1. **Nuclear War**:\n   - The probability of nuclear war is not explicitly stated in the provided sources. However, the context suggests that it is a significant risk, particularly in light of recent developments such as Russia's suspension of participation in a key nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States.\n\n2. **Climate Change**:\n   - The probability of climate change causing an existential catastrophe is not directly stated. However, it is noted that climate change can be a driver for other risks that are existential.\n\n3. **Pandemics**:\n   - The probability of pandemics causing an existential catastrophe is not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that the impact of pandemics can be significant, especially if they are highly transmissible and deadly.\n\n4. **Artificial Intelligence**:\n   - Philosopher Toby Ord estimates a 1-in-6 risk of existential catastrophe by 2120, with 60% of this risk coming from misaligned AI, which translates to a 10% risk of existential catastrophe from misaligned AI by 2120.\n   - A 2021 survey of 44 researchers working on reducing existential risks from AI found the median risk estimate to be 32.5%.\n\nIn summary, while exact probabilities are not provided for all risks, the sources suggest that experts consider these risks significant and potentially existential. The most concrete probability estimates come from the context of AI, with a median risk estimate of 32.5% and a 10% risk of existential catastrophe from misaligned AI by 2120.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/existential-risk-whole-society-challenge\n- https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\n- https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iKLLSYHvnhgcpoBxH/the-precipice-revisited\n## Question: How has the frequency and severity of global catastrophic events changed over the last century?\n  Answer: To help the superforecaster make a better prediction, I have researched the frequency and severity of global catastrophic events over the last century. Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Increase in Natural Disasters**:\n   - The number of natural disasters has increased tenfold since the 1960s. In 1960, there were 39 incidents, while in 2019, there were 396 incidents.\n   - The most common natural disasters are floods, which account for 42% of all disasters since 1990, followed by storms, which account for 30%.\n\n2. **Impact of Climate Change**:\n   - Climate change has increased the likelihood of weather-related natural disasters. Hotter global temperatures lead to more intense storms, wetter monsoons, and a higher risk of droughts.\n\n3. **Death Toll and Economic Costs**:\n   - On average, natural disasters kill 40,000 to 50,000 people per year, although single extreme events can cause tens to hundreds of thousands of deaths.\n   - The economic costs of these events can be severe, particularly in lower-income countries.\n\n4. **Resilience and Progress**:\n   - Despite the increase in disasters, deaths from disasters have fallen significantly over the last century due to early warning systems, better infrastructure, and coordinated responses.\n\nThese findings suggest that while the frequency and severity of global catastrophic events have increased, there has been progress in reducing the impact of these events through improved resilience measures.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.visionofhumanity.org/global-number-of-natural-disasters-increases-ten-times/\n- https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters\n## Question: What technological advancements are expected or predicted that could mitigate existential risks?\n  Answer: To mitigate existential risks by 2100, several technological advancements are expected or predicted:\n\n1. **Advances in Spaceflight, Manufacturing, Robotics, and Terraforming**: These advancements could enable humanity to spread permanently beyond Earth, making civilization more likely to endure.\n\n2. **Early Identification and Deflection of Asteroids**: Active research at NASA and elsewhere aims to identify incoming asteroids and develop methods to shift their paths, reducing the risk of catastrophic impacts.\n\n3. **Mitigation of Supervolcanic Eruptions**: While currently no techniques exist to prevent or mitigate supervolcanic eruptions, future advancements might make this possible, reducing the risk of global catastrophes.\n\n4. **Rewriting Biology and Climate Intervention**: It is expected that within this century, we will be able to rewrite much of biology and intervene in the global climate on a large scale, potentially mitigating risks such as engineered pandemics and extreme climate scenarios.\n\n5. **Artificial Intelligence**: While AI also poses risks, some predictions suggest that AI could be developed to help mitigate existential risks, such as by assisting in the detection and prevention of catastrophic events.\n\nThese technological advancements are crucial in reducing the likelihood of existential catastrophes and ensuring the long-term survival of humanity.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/technological-wild-cards-existential-risk-and-a-changing-humanity/\n- https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\n## Question: What are the current trends in international cooperation and conflict?\n  Answer: To provide context for the larger question of whether the world will end by 2100, current trends in international cooperation and conflict are crucial. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Escalating Conflicts**:\n   - Wars are ongoing in Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine, and peacemaking efforts are in crisis.\n   - The trend towards less armed conflict globally since the end of the Cold War is now reversing.\n\n2. **Regional Tensions**:\n   - Experts are concerned about the escalation of the Israel-Hamas war into a wider regional conflict.\n   - There is a growing risk of a U.S. military confrontation with China or Russia, particularly in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\n3. **Domestic Unrest**:\n   - The leading concern for foreign policy experts is the possibility of domestic terrorism and acts of political violence in the United States, particularly around the 2024 presidential election.\n\n4. **Migration and Economic Pressures**:\n   - A surge in migration to the southwest U.S. border is expected due to criminal violence, corruption, and economic hardship in Central America and Mexico.\n\nThese trends indicate that international cooperation is facing significant challenges, and the risk of conflict is increasing. This information was found in sources from the Crisis Group and the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/10-conflicts-watch-2024\n- https://www.cfr.org/report/conflicts-watch-2024\n## Question: How resilient are human societies to large-scale disruptions based on past events?\n  Answer: To assess the resilience of human societies to large-scale disruptions based on past events, we can draw insights from various studies and research.\n\n1. **Frequent Disturbances Enhanced Resilience**:\n   - Research published in _Nature_ on May 1, 2024, found that frequent disturbances in the past increased the resilience of human populations. This study analyzed evidence of global population change spanning 30,000 years and concluded that the frequency of disturbances played a significant role in enhancing the resilience of survivor populations.\n\n2. **Learning from Past Events**:\n   - The study suggests that experiencing disturbances leads to learning and preparation for future events. This learning process helps populations to better withstand and recover from challenges.\n\n3. **Impact of Land Use**:\n   - The research also found that land use choices significantly affect the ability to withstand and recover from disturbances. For example, farming and herding societies were more likely to experience population declines but were also more resilient overall.\n\n4. **Duration of Disturbances**:\n   - The study revealed that population crashes and recoveries in the past lasted for decades or centuries, with disturbances lasting a median average of 98 years.\n\n5. **Global Comparison**:\n   - This research is the first systematic global comparison of humans' ability to absorb and recover from disturbances through time, making it a landmark study in understanding long-term resilience.\n\nIn summary, human societies have shown resilience to large-scale disruptions in the past, with frequent disturbances enhancing this resilience. The ability to learn from past events and adapt to changing circumstances, as well as the impact of land use choices, are crucial factors in determining the resilience of human societies.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07354-8\n- https://www.dri.edu/frequent-disturbances-increased-the-resilience-of-past-human-populations/\n## Question: What are the predictions from major global risk assessment reports (e.g., Global Challenges Foundation, Future of Humanity Institute) regarding human extinction?\n  Answer: In the context of the larger question 'Will the world end by 2100?', the predictions from major global risk assessment reports regarding human extinction are as follows:\n\n- **Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) Survey (2008)**: The median extinction risk estimates from the survey include:\n  - Total killed by superintelligent AI: 5%\n  - Total killed in all nuclear wars: 1%\n  - Total killed in all acts of nuclear terrorism: 0.03%\n  - Overall risk of extinction prior to 2100: 19%\n\nThese estimates were based on an informal survey among participants at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in Oxford in 2008.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reports/2008-1.pdf\n## Question: What is the current state of research and development in human mind uploading or digital immortality?\n  Answer: The current state of research and development in human mind uploading or digital immortality is actively progressing, though significant hurdles remain. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Digital Immortality Definition**: Digital immortality involves preserving a person's consciousness or aspects of their identity in a digital form beyond their physical death. This includes uploading a person's mind or consciousness onto a computer or network, where it could potentially exist indefinitely.\n\n2. **Technological Hurdles**: There are four main technological hurdles to overcome: uploading consciousness, preserving personal data, developing advanced artificial intelligence, and speech-to-speech synthesis. While the latter three are achievable with current technology, uploading consciousness remains the major obstacle.\n\n3. **Mind Uploading Approaches**: One promising technique is the \"scan and copy\" method, where detailed scans of a preserved brain are used to reproduce a person's biological brain in a computer. This could potentially allow for whole-brain emulation and mind uploading.\n\n4. **Neurotechnology Advancements**: Rapid progress in neurotechnology, such as brain-to-computer interfaces and implantable devices, is allowing for better deciphering of brain waves and potentially modifying the brain. This could contribute to the development of mind uploading technology.\n\n5. **Predictions and Timelines**: Some experts predict that mind uploading could become a reality by 2045, though this timeline is considered optimistic by some. Others believe it could take 100 years or more to achieve.\n\n6. **Ethical and Societal Implications**: The concept of digital immortality raises profound ethical and societal questions, including the potential for misuse and the need to reevaluate what it means to be human. It also poses challenges for theological morality and the concept of an afterlife.\n\nSources:\n- https://atos.net/advancing-what-matters/en/blog/digital-immortality\n- https://theconversation.com/how-uploading-our-minds-to-a-computer-might-become-possible-206804\n- https://bigthink.com/the-well/will-humanity-become-digitally-immortal/\n## Question: How has the global investment in and focus on existential risk reduction changed over recent years?\n  Answer: The global investment in and focus on existential risk reduction have undergone significant changes over recent years. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Increased Awareness and Concern**: The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report 2024 highlights that the majority of respondents (54%) anticipate some instability and a moderate risk of global catastrophes in the short term, while another 27% expect greater turbulence. This increased awareness and concern about global risks have led to a greater focus on existential risk reduction.\n\n2. **Cost-of-Living Crisis**: The Global Risks Report 2023 ranked the \"cost-of-living crisis\" as the most severe global risk over the next two years, peaking in the short term. This crisis has likely shifted some focus towards immediate economic and social challenges, potentially diverting attention from long-term existential risks.\n\n3. **Biodiversity Loss and Environmental Risks**: The Global Risks Report 2023 also emphasized biodiversity loss and environmental risks as significant concerns. This increased focus on environmental issues might have led to more investment in mitigating these risks, which are closely tied to existential risks.\n\n4. **Technological Risks**: The Global Risks Report 2024 mentions AI-generated misinformation and disinformation as a significant risk, with 53% of respondents selecting it as a top risk for 2024. This growing concern about technological risks, including AI, has likely led to increased investment in mitigating these risks.\n\n5. **Forecasting and Prediction**: The Metaculus platform, which focuses on predicting future events, has seen increased activity and discussion around existential risks. For example, a Metaculus Pro Forecaster, Jared Leibowich, has emphasized the importance of creativity in forecasting and has explored the potential for sentient AI to be granted legal rights by 2035. This increased discussion and forecasting around existential risks indicates a growing focus on these issues.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/digest/\n- https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/in-full/responding-to-global-risks/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/17507/seeing-the-future-through-fiction-how-to-harness-your-creativity-for-forecasting/\n- https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2024.pdf\n## Question: What are the trends in global political stability and governance?\n  Answer: To provide insights on trends in global political stability and governance in the context of the larger question \"Will the world end by 2100?\", several key points can be highlighted:\n\n1. **Rise in Political Polarization and Inequality**: The article from Population Connection notes that global inequality and political polarization are on the rise, which does not bode well for the resilience of modern societies. This trend could contribute to societal collapse if not addressed.\n\n2. **Impact of Elections and Political Instability**: Control Risks highlights that 2024 will see over 40 parliamentary and presidential elections, which could lead to political instability and changes in governance. The US elections in November 2024 are particularly significant, as they may impact geopolitical risk throughout the year.\n\n3. **Geopolitical Regulatory Competition**: Control Risks also notes that geopolitical events will continue to motivate both transnational and homegrown terrorist activity, posing challenges to government security services and corporate security managers.\n\n4. **Environmental Activism and Governance**: Climate-related activism is expected to increase in 2024, with perceived inaction on climate commitments by governments and companies likely to lead to more protests and targeted actions. This could impact governance and political stability.\n\n5. **Global Economic Resilience**: The global economic outlook will be impacted by geopolitical trends, including regional conflicts, sanctions, and more protectionist trade policies. This could lead to political stability and unrest risks.\n\nThese trends suggest that global political stability and governance are facing significant challenges, which could contribute to the likelihood of societal collapse by 2100.\n\nSources:\n- https://populationconnection.org/blog/are-we-nearing-global-collapse/\n- https://www.metaculus.com\n- https://www.theguardian.com/music/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/29/if-the-world-ends-in-2100-were-probably-ok\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.controlrisks.com/our-thinking/insights/ten-global-topics-and-trends-to-watch-in-2024\n## Question: What are the predictions of long-term survival from experts in fields like futurology, risk analysis, and global security?\n  Answer: To provide insights on long-term survival predictions from experts in fields like futurology, risk analysis, and global security, I have gathered information from various sources:\n\n1. **Metaculus Community Forecasts**:\n   - The Metaculus community has forecasted the global population in 2122 to be around 8 or 9 billion, with a possibility of reaching 20 billion due to technological and economic advancements.\n\n2. **Pew Research Center**:\n   - Experts predict significant changes for the worse in the next five years, including the rise of totalitarian measures, economic depression, and the breakdown of society and supply chains.\n\n3. **Atlantic Council Survey**:\n   - A survey of 167 experts predicts a high likelihood of global economic crises and pandemics by 2033, with 76% expecting another global economic crisis and 49% foreseeing another global pandemic.\n\n4. **Humane Future of Work**:\n   - The world in 2100 is expected to be hotter, more populous, and technologically advanced, with a different world order and potentially less or no work.\n\nThese predictions highlight the uncertainty and potential risks associated with long-term survival, including the impact of climate change, economic instability, and technological advancements.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/14965/forecasting-our-world-in-data-the-next-100-years/\n- https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/02/18/worries-about-life-in-2025/\n- https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/atlantic-council-strategy-paper-series/welcome-to-2033/\n- https://humanefutureofwork.com/what-will-the-world-be-like-in-2100/\n## Question: What are the estimates for the probability of accidental or deliberate use of weapons of mass destruction in the next century?\n  Answer: To provide estimates for the probability of accidental or deliberate use of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in the next century, we need to consider various factors and sources.\n\n### Accidental Use\n\n- **Nuclear Accidents**: The risk of nuclear accidents is a significant concern. For instance, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 demonstrate the potential for catastrophic consequences. These events highlight the importance of safety measures and international cooperation to prevent such incidents.\n\n### Deliberate Use\n\n- **Deliberate Events (DEs)**: The World Health Organization (WHO) defines DEs as malicious acts intended to cause harm, including the use of chemical, biological, and radiological agents. These events can have significant health and security implications, and the WHO works to prevent and respond to such incidents.\n- **Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs)**: NATO is actively working to prevent the proliferation of WMDs through arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation efforts.\n- **Dual-Use Research**: Scientific advances in fields like gene editing and reconstruction can lead to the creation of new pathogens, increasing the risk of deliberate use of WMDs.\n\n### Probability Estimates\n\n- **Metaculus Predictions**: While there are no specific predictions on Metaculus for the probability of accidental or deliberate use of WMDs by 2100, the platform allows users to make predictions and aggregate collective wisdom on various topics, including global events and risks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEstimating the probability of accidental or deliberate use of WMDs in the next century is a complex task. It involves considering various factors such as nuclear safety, deliberate events, and the proliferation of WMDs. While there are no specific probability estimates available, the risks associated with these events are well-documented, and international efforts are underway to mitigate them.\n\n**Sources:**\n- https://www.metaculus.com\n- https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deliberate-events\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/occasional/cswmd/CSWMD_OccationalPaper-8.pdf\n- https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_50325.htm\n## Question: What are the latest developments in space colonization and its feasibility by 2100?\n  Answer: The latest developments in space colonization and its feasibility by 2100 indicate that significant advancements are needed to achieve human exploration and settlement beyond Mars and the asteroid belts. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Human Exploration Beyond Mars**:\n   - By 2100, there is a possibility of having science outposts on the Moon and Mars, with a thriving Earth orbit economy focused on observation and other activities.\n   - Some predict that colonies might be established on the Moon and Mars, and possibly even in the Asteroid Belt or Jupiter/Saturn's moons.\n\n2. **Propulsion Technology**:\n   - Dramatic improvements in space propulsion are required for manned spaceflight to Jupiter, Saturn, and the outer gas planets. Nuclear thermal/electric propulsion could help reduce travel time, but the development of fusion propulsion and advanced drives like the Epstein drive would be necessary for more rapid travel.\n\n3. **Challenges and Funding**:\n   - The main obstacle to progress is not technology but funding. The Apollo program's success was largely driven by the Cold War, and similar motivations are needed to drive investment in space exploration.\n   - The development of advanced propulsion technologies, such as fusion, is contingent on significant funding, which has been lacking in recent years.\n\n4. **Economic Viability**:\n   - For space colonization to be economically viable, there needs to be a compelling business case. Currently, the main customers are on Earth, so selling products or services to Earth-based customers is necessary to justify the costs of deep space operations.\n\n5. **NASA's Strategy**:\n   - NASA has outlined a strategy for human exploration of the solar system by 2100, which involves the development of advanced propulsion technologies, such as nuclear-based propulsion, and space habitats capable of sustaining life in harsh environments.\n\nIn summary, while there are ambitious plans for space colonization by 2100, significant technological advancements and substantial funding are required to make these plans a reality.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/15hju4u/human_space_exploration_reach_beyond_mars_and_the/\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceflight/comments/16ms82p/where_will_spaceflight_be_in_2100/\n- https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20170001554/downloads/20170001554.pdf\n\n# FORECASTS\n## Reasoning from forecaster 0\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - [Metaculus] Metaculus questions resolve positively 41% of the time\n  - [Future of Humanity Institute Survey, 2008] Overall risk of extinction prior to 2100: 19%\n  - [Toby Ord] 1-in-6 risk of existential catastrophe by 2120: 16.67%\n  - [Superforecasters] Experts predict a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100 due to AI\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.19\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: The most appropriate base rate is 19% from the Future of Humanity Institute Survey, as it directly estimates the overall risk of human extinction before 2100, which aligns closely with the question's resolution criteria.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - [Superforecasters] Experts predict a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100 due to AI\n  - [Toby Ord] 1-in-6 risk of existential catastrophe by 2120, with 60% of this risk coming from misaligned AI\n  - [WHO] Deliberate events involving WMDs, including chemical, biological, and radiological agents, pose significant risks\n  - [Crisis Group and Council on Foreign Relations] Escalating conflicts and risk of U.S. military confrontation with China or Russia\n\n**Cons**: \n  - [Nature Study, 2024] Frequent disturbances have increased the resilience of human societies over 30,000 years\n  - [Our World in Data] Despite challenges, human societies have shown the ability to adapt and thrive, with improved resilience measures\n  - [NASA Strategy] Advancements in space colonization could increase the long-term survival of humanity\n  - [BBVA OpenMind] Technological advancements, such as space colonization and rewriting biology, could mitigate existential risks\n\n**Reasoning**: Starting with the chosen base rate of 19% from the Future of Humanity Institute, I will consider the pros and cons. The 6% chance of AI-related extinction and the risk of deliberate use of WMDs are significant existential threats, but they are already captured in the chosen base rate. The escalating conflicts and geopolitical instability also add weight to the positive resolution. However, the resilience of human societies as demonstrated by past events, advances in technology, and potential for space colonization should reduce the probability of extinction. Given the balanced nature of the pros and cons, I will make a slight downward adjustment to account for human resilience and technological advancements, adjusting the base rate down by 3% to 16% (0.16).\n\n**Prediction**: 16.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 1\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - Historical mass extinction events (5 in over 500 million years) suggest a very low base rate of total extinction events on a geological timescale.\n  - Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute (2008) estimates a 19% overall risk of human extinction by 2100.\n  - Metaculus average resolution rate of 41% for questions resolving positively.\n  - Toby Ord's estimate of a 1-in-6 (approximately 16.67%) risk of existential catastrophe by 2120.\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.19\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: The most appropriate base rate is the 19% estimate for human extinction by 2100 from Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute. This is because it specifically addresses the overall risk of human extinction by a similar timeframe and aggregates expert opinions on various existential risks.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - Existential risks such as AI, climate change, nuclear war, and pandemics all pose significant threats.\n  - Increased frequency and severity of natural disasters due to climate change.\n  - Technological advancements like AI could potentially lead to uncontrollable scenarios if misaligned.\n\n**Cons**: \n  - Human societies have shown resilience to large-scale disruptions in the past.\n  - Technological advancements in risk mitigation, such as asteroid deflection and climate intervention, are expected.\n  - Global efforts and investments in existential risk reduction have increased.\n  - Predictions show continued habitability of Earth despite challenges posed by climate change.\n\n**Reasoning**: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 19% from Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute. Given the significant existential threats like AI, climate change, nuclear war, and pandemics, I'll adjust up slightly by 5% to 24%. However, considering the historical resilience of human societies and ongoing advancements in technology and risk mitigation, I'll adjust down by 6% to 18%. Lastly, considering the increased global investment in existential risk reduction, I'll adjust down by another 2% to 16%.\n\n**Prediction**: 16.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 2\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - [Global Challenges Foundation, Future of Humanity Institute] Overall risk of extinction prior to 2100: 19%\n  - [Freethink] Experts predict a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100 due to AI\n  - [80,000 Hours] 32.5% median risk estimate of existential catastrophe from AI\n  - [Metaculus] Metaculus resolve positively 41% of the time, so there is a 41% base rate\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.19\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: The most appropriate base rate is 19% from the Global Challenges Foundation and Future of Humanity Institute because it encompasses overall risk of extinction by 2100, which aligns perfectly with the question's criteria about the end of all biological human life.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - [WHO] The definition of deliberate events (DEs) includes malicious acts intended to cause harm, indicating a risk from weapons of mass destruction.\n  - [Climate MIT] Unchecked climate change could lead to catastrophic consequences.\n  - [Freethink] Experts predict a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100 due to AI.\n\n**Cons**: \n  - [Nature] Research shows that frequent disturbances enhance the resilience of human populations.\n  - [Our World in Data] Despite the increase in disasters, deaths from disasters have fallen significantly due to improved resilience measures.\n  - [BBVA] Technological advancements in early identification and deflection of asteroids, rewriting biology, and climate intervention could mitigate existential risks.\n\n**Reasoning**: Starting with the chosen base rate of 19% from the Global Challenges Foundation and Future of Humanity Institute. The pros include significant risks from AI, climate change, and deliberate events such as WMDs, but these are counterbalanced by human societies' demonstrated resilience and ongoing technological advancements. No strong aggregated data to sway significantly from the base rate. Adjusting slightly downwards to account for historical resilience and technological mitigation efforts, I'll reduce by 3% for resilience and another 3% for technological mitigation, leading to a final prediction of 13%.\n\n**Prediction**: 13.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 3\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - [Natural History Museum] Historical extinction events suggest a base rate of species extinction at five major events in 500 million years, which translates to a base rate of 0.001% per million years.\n  - [80,000 Hours article] Toby Ord estimates a 1-in-6 risk of existential catastrophe by 2120, which translates to approximately 16.67% by 2120.\n  - [Metaculus platform] Superforecasters put the odds of AI causing human extinction by 2100 at 1%.\n  - [Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) Survey (2008)] The overall risk of human extinction prior to 2100 was estimated at 19%.\n  - [Metaculus baseline] Metaculus questions resolve positively 41% of the time.\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.19\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 19% from the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) Survey (2008) because it aggregates expert opinion specifically about human extinction within a similar timeframe.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - There is a significant risk of AI (10% by 2120) and nuclear war, which could collectively increase the chances of human extinction.\n  - Climate change, if unchecked, could lead to catastrophic consequences that disrupt human societies.\n  - Technological advancements in synthetic biology and dual-use research increase risks of engineered pandemics.\n\n**Cons**: \n  - Human societies have shown resilience to large-scale disruptions and have adapted well to past challenges.\n  - Advancements in technology might mitigate some of the existential risks, such as asteroid deflection and climate intervention.\n  - International cooperation and increased focus on existential risk reduction have improved over recent years, which might reduce overall risks.\n\n**Reasoning**: Starting with the chosen base rate of 19% from the FHI survey. Given the significant risks from AI, nuclear war, climate change, and synthetic biology, I will adjust the probability up by 5% to 24%. However, considering human resilience, technological advancements in mitigating risks, and improved international cooperation, I will adjust down by 7% to 17%.\n\n**Prediction**: 17.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 4\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - Based on the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) Survey (2008), there is a 19% base rate for overall risk of extinction prior to 2100.\n  - Philosopher Toby Ord estimates a 1-in-6 risk of existential catastrophe by 2120, which is approximately 16.67%.\n  - Experts predict a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100 due to AI.\n  - Superforecasters put the odds of human extinction by AI at 1%.\n  - Metaculus questions resolve positively 41% of the time, so there is a 41% base rate.\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.19\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 19% from the Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) Survey (2008) because it encompasses a broad range of existential risks including AI, nuclear war, and other catastrophic events, which is more comprehensive for the question at hand.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - Experts have identified significant existential risks including supervolcanic eruptions, AI, and climate change.\n  - Climate change is expected to cause severe disruptions and potentially catastrophic consequences.\n  - Technological advancements in AI could lead to uncontrollable scenarios posing a threat to humanity.\n  - Escalating conflicts and political instability increase the risk of large-scale disruptions.\n\n**Cons**: \n  - Technological advancements in spaceflight, AI, and neurotechnology could mitigate existential risks.\n  - Increased resilience of human societies to large-scale disruptions based on past events.\n  - Significant efforts and investments in existential risk reduction are ongoing.\n  - Predictions of long-term survival suggest humans could adapt to changing environments and societal challenges.\n\n**Reasoning**: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 19%. Considering the pros, the significant existential risks like climate change, AI, and political instability warrant a slight increase, I'll adjust up by 5% to 24%. However, the cons such as technological advancements, increased resilience, and current efforts in risk reduction suggest a slight decrease, I'll adjust down by 4% to 20%.

Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Mass Extinctions**: There have been five major mass extinctions in Earth's history, each resulting in the loss of a large number of species. These events occurred at the end of the Cretaceous (66 million years ago), Late Triassic (199 million years ago), End Permian (252 million years ago), Late Devonian (378 million years ago), and Late Ordovician (447 million years ago) periods.\n\n2. **Current Extinction Rate**: The current rate of species extinction is estimated to be up to 10,000 times higher than the natural, historical rate. This is largely driven by human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change.\n\n3. **Species at Risk**: At least 15,000 species are currently threatened with extinction, out of an estimated eight million species on Earth.\n\n4. **Recent Extinctions**: Since the end of the last ice age, many species have gone extinct due to climate changes and human activities such as overhunting and habitat destruction. Industrialization has further accelerated extinction rates.\n\nThese points highlight the significant impact of human activities on species extinction rates and the need for conservation efforts to mitigate these effects.\n\nSources:\n- https://naturalhistory.si.edu/education/teaching-resources/paleontology/extinction-over-time\n- https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/planet-earth/forests-and-deserts/species-extinction-rate\n## Question: How has the human population size and distribution changed over the last century?\n  Answer: To provide context for the larger question of whether the world will end by 2100, let's examine how the human population size and distribution have changed over the last century.\n\n### Population Growth and Distribution\n\n- **Population Size**: The global population has grown significantly over the last century. In 1800, there were approximately one billion people, and today there are over eight billion.\n- **Growth Rate**: The population growth rate peaked in the 1960s at over 2% per year and has since declined to less than 1%. The UN projects that this decline will continue until the end of the century, with negative growth (population shrinkage) expected towards the end of the century.\n- **Peak Child**: The number of children under the age of five has peaked and is expected to decline in the coming decades.\n- **Regional Distribution**: By 2100, more than 8 out of 10 people in the world will live in Asia or Africa.\n\n### Impact of Climate Change\n\n- **Sea Level Rise**: Rising sea levels will significantly alter coastlines, making many cities uninhabitable and displacing hundreds of millions of people. Cities like London, New York, Bangkok, and others will be at risk of flooding.\n- **Climate Migration**: Climate change will lead to increased migration, food shortages, and the spread of infectious diseases due to more frequent and long-lasting heatwaves.\n\n### Habitability and Adaptation\n\n- **Habitability**: Despite the challenges posed by climate change, the Earth will still be habitable in 2100. Humans have adapted to extreme environments and will continue to do so, but the planet's habitability will be affected by rising temperatures, sea level rise, and ecosystem changes.\n\n### Sources\n\n- https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth\n- https://www.earth.com/news/how-will-the-world-look-in-2100-due-to-climate-change/\n- https://michigantoday.umich.edu/2021/06/25/will-the-earth-be-habitable-in-2100/\n## Question: What are the primary existential risks currently identified by experts?\n  Answer: In the context of the larger question 'Will the world end by 2100?', the primary existential risks currently identified by experts include:\n\n1. **Supervolcanic Eruptions**: These rare events have the potential to cause catastrophic global consequences, including widespread destruction of ecosystems, disruption of global agriculture, and long-term climate change. The most recent supereruption on record occurred at Indonesia's Toba Caldera approximately 74,000 years ago, which likely triggered a volcanic winter and significantly reduced the global human population.\n\n2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Experts predict a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100 due to AI, while superforecasters put the odds at 1%. This risk is associated with the potential for AI to become uncontrollable and pose a threat to humanity.\n\n3. **Climate Change**: Climate change is considered an existential threat due to its potential to cause mass extinctions and disrupt human societies. Unchecked climate change could lead to global temperatures increasing by 4.5 degrees Celsius or more by 2100, which would have catastrophic consequences.\n\nThese risks are identified by experts in various fields, including volcanology, AI research, and climate science.\n\nSources:\n- https://globaia.org/risks\n- https://www.freethink.com/robots-ai/ai-predictions-superforecasters\n- https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/why-do-some-people-call-climate-change-existential-threat\n## Question: What probability do experts assign to existential risks such as nuclear war, climate change, pandemics, and artificial intelligence by 2100?\n  Answer: To provide a comprehensive answer to the question, I will break down the probabilities assigned to each of the mentioned existential risks by experts:\n\n1. **Nuclear War**:\n   - The probability of nuclear war is not explicitly stated in the provided sources. However, the context suggests that it is a significant risk, particularly in light of recent developments such as Russia's suspension of participation in a key nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States.\n\n2. **Climate Change**:\n   - The probability of climate change causing an existential catastrophe is not directly stated. However, it is noted that climate change can be a driver for other risks that are existential.\n\n3. **Pandemics**:\n   - The probability of pandemics causing an existential catastrophe is not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that the impact of pandemics can be significant, especially if they are highly transmissible and deadly.\n\n4. **Artificial Intelligence**:\n   - Philosopher Toby Ord estimates a 1-in-6 risk of existential catastrophe by 2120, with 60% of this risk coming from misaligned AI, which translates to a 10% risk of existential catastrophe from misaligned AI by 2120.\n   - A 2021 survey of 44 researchers working on reducing existential risks from AI found the median risk estimate to be 32.5%.\n\nIn summary, while exact probabilities are not provided for all risks, the sources suggest that experts consider these risks significant and potentially existential. The most concrete probability estimates come from the context of AI, with a median risk estimate of 32.5% and a 10% risk of existential catastrophe from misaligned AI by 2120.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/existential-risk-whole-society-challenge\n- https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\n- https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iKLLSYHvnhgcpoBxH/the-precipice-revisited\n## Question: How has the frequency and severity of global catastrophic events changed over the last century?\n  Answer: To help the superforecaster make a better prediction, I have researched the frequency and severity of global catastrophic events over the last century. Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Increase in Natural Disasters**:\n   - The number of natural disasters has increased tenfold since the 1960s. In 1960, there were 39 incidents, while in 2019, there were 396 incidents.\n   - The most common natural disasters are floods, which account for 42% of all disasters since 1990, followed by storms, which account for 30%.\n\n2. **Impact of Climate Change**:\n   - Climate change has increased the likelihood of weather-related natural disasters. Hotter global temperatures lead to more intense storms, wetter monsoons, and a higher risk of droughts.\n\n3. **Death Toll and Economic Costs**:\n   - On average, natural disasters kill 40,000 to 50,000 people per year, although single extreme events can cause tens to hundreds of thousands of deaths.\n   - The economic costs of these events can be severe, particularly in lower-income countries.\n\n4. **Resilience and Progress**:\n   - Despite the increase in disasters, deaths from disasters have fallen significantly over the last century due to early warning systems, better infrastructure, and coordinated responses.\n\nThese findings suggest that while the frequency and severity of global catastrophic events have increased, there has been progress in reducing the impact of these events through improved resilience measures.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.visionofhumanity.org/global-number-of-natural-disasters-increases-ten-times/\n- https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters\n## Question: What technological advancements are expected or predicted that could mitigate existential risks?\n  Answer: To mitigate existential risks by 2100, several technological advancements are expected or predicted:\n\n1. **Advances in Spaceflight, Manufacturing, Robotics, and Terraforming**: These advancements could enable humanity to spread permanently beyond Earth, making civilization more likely to endure.\n\n2. **Early Identification and Deflection of Asteroids**: Active research at NASA and elsewhere aims to identify incoming asteroids and develop methods to shift their paths, reducing the risk of catastrophic impacts.\n\n3. **Mitigation of Supervolcanic Eruptions**: While currently no techniques exist to prevent or mitigate supervolcanic eruptions, future advancements might make this possible, reducing the risk of global catastrophes.\n\n4. **Rewriting Biology and Climate Intervention**: It is expected that within this century, we will be able to rewrite much of biology and intervene in the global climate on a large scale, potentially mitigating risks such as engineered pandemics and extreme climate scenarios.\n\n5. **Artificial Intelligence**: While AI also poses risks, some predictions suggest that AI could be developed to help mitigate existential risks, such as by assisting in the detection and prevention of catastrophic events.\n\nThese technological advancements are crucial in reducing the likelihood of existential catastrophes and ensuring the long-term survival of humanity.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/technological-wild-cards-existential-risk-and-a-changing-humanity/\n- https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\n## Question: What are the current trends in international cooperation and conflict?\n  Answer: To provide context for the larger question of whether the world will end by 2100, current trends in international cooperation and conflict are crucial. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Escalating Conflicts**:\n   - Wars are ongoing in Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine, and peacemaking efforts are in crisis.\n   - The trend towards less armed conflict globally since the end of the Cold War is now reversing.\n\n2. **Regional Tensions**:\n   - Experts are concerned about the escalation of the Israel-Hamas war into a wider regional conflict.\n   - There is a growing risk of a U.S. military confrontation with China or Russia, particularly in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\n3. **Domestic Unrest**:\n   - The leading concern for foreign policy experts is the possibility of domestic terrorism and acts of political violence in the United States, particularly around the 2024 presidential election.\n\n4. **Migration and Economic Pressures**:\n   - A surge in migration to the southwest U.S. border is expected due to criminal violence, corruption, and economic hardship in Central America and Mexico.\n\nThese trends indicate that international cooperation is facing significant challenges, and the risk of conflict is increasing. This information was found in sources from the Crisis Group and the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/10-conflicts-watch-2024\n- https://www.cfr.org/report/conflicts-watch-2024\n## Question: How resilient are human societies to large-scale disruptions based on past events?\n  Answer: To assess the resilience of human societies to large-scale disruptions based on past events, we can draw insights from various studies and research.\n\n1. **Frequent Disturbances Enhanced Resilience**:\n   - Research published in _Nature_ on May 1, 2024, found that frequent disturbances in the past increased the resilience of human populations. This study analyzed evidence of global population change spanning 30,000 years and concluded that the frequency of disturbances played a significant role in enhancing the resilience of survivor populations.\n\n2. **Learning from Past Events**:\n   - The study suggests that experiencing disturbances leads to learning and preparation for future events. This learning process helps populations to better withstand and recover from challenges.\n\n3. **Impact of Land Use**:\n   - The research also found that land use choices significantly affect the ability to withstand and recover from disturbances. For example, farming and herding societies were more likely to experience population declines but were also more resilient overall.\n\n4. **Duration of Disturbances**:\n   - The study revealed that population crashes and recoveries in the past lasted for decades or centuries, with disturbances lasting a median average of 98 years.\n\n5. **Global Comparison**:\n   - This research is the first systematic global comparison of humans' ability to absorb and recover from disturbances through time, making it a landmark study in understanding long-term resilience.\n\nIn summary, human societies have shown resilience to large-scale disruptions in the past, with frequent disturbances enhancing this resilience. The ability to learn from past events and adapt to changing circumstances, as well as the impact of land use choices, are crucial factors in determining the resilience of human societies.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07354-8\n- https://www.dri.edu/frequent-disturbances-increased-the-resilience-of-past-human-populations/\n## Question: What are the predictions from major global risk assessment reports (e.g., Global Challenges Foundation, Future of Humanity Institute) regarding human extinction?\n  Answer: In the context of the larger question 'Will the world end by 2100?', the predictions from major global risk assessment reports regarding human extinction are as follows:\n\n- **Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) Survey (2008)**: The median extinction risk estimates from the survey include:\n  - Total killed by superintelligent AI: 5%\n  - Total killed in all nuclear wars: 1%\n  - Total killed in all acts of nuclear terrorism: 0.03%\n  - Overall risk of extinction prior to 2100: 19%\n\nThese estimates were based on an informal survey among participants at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in Oxford in 2008.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reports/2008-1.pdf\n## Question: What is the current state of research and development in human mind uploading or digital immortality?\n  Answer: The current state of research and development in human mind uploading or digital immortality is actively progressing, though significant hurdles remain. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Digital Immortality Definition**: Digital immortality involves preserving a person's consciousness or aspects of their identity in a digital form beyond their physical death. This includes uploading a person's mind or consciousness onto a computer or network, where it could potentially exist indefinitely.\n\n2. **Technological Hurdles**: There are four main technological hurdles to overcome: uploading consciousness, preserving personal data, developing advanced artificial intelligence, and speech-to-speech synthesis. While the latter three are achievable with current technology, uploading consciousness remains the major obstacle.\n\n3. **Mind Uploading Approaches**: One promising technique is the \"scan and copy\" method, where detailed scans of a preserved brain are used to reproduce a person's biological brain in a computer. This could potentially allow for whole-brain emulation and mind uploading.\n\n4. **Neurotechnology Advancements**: Rapid progress in neurotechnology, such as brain-to-computer interfaces and implantable devices, is allowing for better deciphering of brain waves and potentially modifying the brain. This could contribute to the development of mind uploading technology.\n\n5. **Predictions and Timelines**: Some experts predict that mind uploading could become a reality by 2045, though this timeline is considered optimistic by some. Others believe it could take 100 years or more to achieve.\n\n6. **Ethical and Societal Implications**: The concept of digital immortality raises profound ethical and societal questions, including the potential for misuse and the need to reevaluate what it means to be human. It also poses challenges for theological morality and the concept of an afterlife.\n\nSources:\n- https://atos.net/advancing-what-matters/en/blog/digital-immortality\n- https://theconversation.com/how-uploading-our-minds-to-a-computer-might-become-possible-206804\n- https://bigthink.com/the-well/will-humanity-become-digitally-immortal/\n## Question: How has the global investment in and focus on existential risk reduction changed over recent years?\n  Answer: The global investment in and focus on existential risk reduction have undergone significant changes over recent years. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Increased Awareness and Concern**: The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report 2024 highlights that the majority of respondents (54%) anticipate some instability and a moderate risk of global catastrophes in the short term, while another 27% expect greater turbulence. This increased awareness and concern about global risks have led to a greater focus on existential risk reduction.\n\n2. **Cost-of-Living Crisis**: The Global Risks Report 2023 ranked the \"cost-of-living crisis\" as the most severe global risk over the next two years, peaking in the short term. This crisis has likely shifted some focus towards immediate economic and social challenges, potentially diverting attention from long-term existential risks.\n\n3. **Biodiversity Loss and Environmental Risks**: The Global Risks Report 2023 also emphasized biodiversity loss and environmental risks as significant concerns. This increased focus on environmental issues might have led to more investment in mitigating these risks, which are closely tied to existential risks.\n\n4. **Technological Risks**: The Global Risks Report 2024 mentions AI-generated misinformation and disinformation as a significant risk, with 53% of respondents selecting it as a top risk for 2024. This growing concern about technological risks, including AI, has likely led to increased investment in mitigating these risks.\n\n5. **Forecasting and Prediction**: The Metaculus platform, which focuses on predicting future events, has seen increased activity and discussion around existential risks. For example, a Metaculus Pro Forecaster, Jared Leibowich, has emphasized the importance of creativity in forecasting and has explored the potential for sentient AI to be granted legal rights by 2035. This increased discussion and forecasting around existential risks indicates a growing focus on these issues.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/digest/\n- https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/in-full/responding-to-global-risks/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/17507/seeing-the-future-through-fiction-how-to-harness-your-creativity-for-forecasting/\n- https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2024.pdf\n## Question: What are the trends in global political stability and governance?\n  Answer: To provide insights on trends in global political stability and governance in the context of the larger question \"Will the world end by 2100?\", several key points can be highlighted:\n\n1. **Rise in Political Polarization and Inequality**: The article from Population Connection notes that global inequality and political polarization are on the rise, which does not bode well for the resilience of modern societies. This trend could contribute to societal collapse if not addressed.\n\n2. **Impact of Elections and Political Instability**: Control Risks highlights that 2024 will see over 40 parliamentary and presidential elections, which could lead to political instability and changes in governance. The US elections in November 2024 are particularly significant, as they may impact geopolitical risk throughout the year.\n\n3. **Geopolitical Regulatory Competition**: Control Risks also notes that geopolitical events will continue to motivate both transnational and homegrown terrorist activity, posing challenges to government security services and corporate security managers.\n\n4. **Environmental Activism and Governance**: Climate-related activism is expected to increase in 2024, with perceived inaction on climate commitments by governments and companies likely to lead to more protests and targeted actions. This could impact governance and political stability.\n\n5. **Global Economic Resilience**: The global economic outlook will be impacted by geopolitical trends, including regional conflicts, sanctions, and more protectionist trade policies. This could lead to political stability and unrest risks.\n\nThese trends suggest that global political stability and governance are facing significant challenges, which could contribute to the likelihood of societal collapse by 2100.\n\nSources:\n- https://populationconnection.org/blog/are-we-nearing-global-collapse/\n- https://www.metaculus.com\n- https://www.theguardian.com/music/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/29/if-the-world-ends-in-2100-were-probably-ok\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.controlrisks.com/our-thinking/insights/ten-global-topics-and-trends-to-watch-in-2024\n## Question: What are the predictions of long-term survival from experts in fields like futurology, risk analysis, and global security?\n  Answer: To provide insights on long-term survival predictions from experts in fields like futurology, risk analysis, and global security, I have gathered information from various sources:\n\n1. **Metaculus Community Forecasts**:\n   - The Metaculus community has forecasted the global population in 2122 to be around 8 or 9 billion, with a possibility of reaching 20 billion due to technological and economic advancements.\n\n2. **Pew Research Center**:\n   - Experts predict significant changes for the worse in the next five years, including the rise of totalitarian measures, economic depression, and the breakdown of society and supply chains.\n\n3. **Atlantic Council Survey**:\n   - A survey of 167 experts predicts a high likelihood of global economic crises and pandemics by 2033, with 76% expecting another global economic crisis and 49% foreseeing another global pandemic.\n\n4. **Humane Future of Work**:\n   - The world in 2100 is expected to be hotter, more populous, and technologically advanced, with a different world order and potentially less or no work.\n\nThese predictions highlight the uncertainty and potential risks associated with long-term survival, including the impact of climate change, economic instability, and technological advancements.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/14965/forecasting-our-world-in-data-the-next-100-years/\n- https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/02/18/worries-about-life-in-2025/\n- https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/atlantic-council-strategy-paper-series/welcome-to-2033/\n- https://humanefutureofwork.com/what-will-the-world-be-like-in-2100/\n## Question: What are the estimates for the probability of accidental or deliberate use of weapons of mass destruction in the next century?\n  Answer: To provide estimates for the probability of accidental or deliberate use of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in the next century, we need to consider various factors and sources.\n\n### Accidental Use\n\n- **Nuclear Accidents**: The risk of nuclear accidents is a significant concern. For instance, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 demonstrate the potential for catastrophic consequences. These events highlight the importance of safety measures and international cooperation to prevent such incidents.\n\n### Deliberate Use\n\n- **Deliberate Events (DEs)**: The World Health Organization (WHO) defines DEs as malicious acts intended to cause harm, including the use of chemical, biological, and radiological agents. These events can have significant health and security implications, and the WHO works to prevent and respond to such incidents.\n- **Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs)**: NATO is actively working to prevent the proliferation of WMDs through arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation efforts.\n- **Dual-Use Research**: Scientific advances in fields like gene editing and reconstruction can lead to the creation of new pathogens, increasing the risk of deliberate use of WMDs.\n\n### Probability Estimates\n\n- **Metaculus Predictions**: While there are no specific predictions on Metaculus for the probability of accidental or deliberate use of WMDs by 2100, the platform allows users to make predictions and aggregate collective wisdom on various topics, including global events and risks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEstimating the probability of accidental or deliberate use of WMDs in the next century is a complex task. It involves considering various factors such as nuclear safety, deliberate events, and the proliferation of WMDs. While there are no specific probability estimates available, the risks associated with these events are well-documented, and international efforts are underway to mitigate them.\n\n**Sources:**\n- https://www.metaculus.com\n- https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deliberate-events\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/occasional/cswmd/CSWMD_OccationalPaper-8.pdf\n- https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_50325.htm\n## Question: What are the latest developments in space colonization and its feasibility by 2100?\n  Answer: The latest developments in space colonization and its feasibility by 2100 indicate that significant advancements are needed to achieve human exploration and settlement beyond Mars and the asteroid belts. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Human Exploration Beyond Mars**:\n   - By 2100, there is a possibility of having science outposts on the Moon and Mars, with a thriving Earth orbit economy focused on observation and other activities.\n   - Some predict that colonies might be established on the Moon and Mars, and possibly even in the Asteroid Belt or Jupiter/Saturn's moons.\n\n2. **Propulsion Technology**:\n   - Dramatic improvements in space propulsion are required for manned spaceflight to Jupiter, Saturn, and the outer gas planets. Nuclear thermal/electric propulsion could help reduce travel time, but the development of fusion propulsion and advanced drives like the Epstein drive would be necessary for more rapid travel.\n\n3. **Challenges and Funding**:\n   - The main obstacle to progress is not technology but funding. The Apollo program's success was largely driven by the Cold War, and similar motivations are needed to drive investment in space exploration.\n   - The development of advanced propulsion technologies, such as fusion, is contingent on significant funding, which has been lacking in recent years.\n\n4. **Economic Viability**:\n   - For space colonization to be economically viable, there needs to be a compelling business case. Currently, the main customers are on Earth, so selling products or services to Earth-based customers is necessary to justify the costs of deep space operations.\n\n5. **NASA's Strategy**:\n   - NASA has outlined a strategy for human exploration of the solar system by 2100, which involves the development of advanced propulsion technologies, such as nuclear-based propulsion, and space habitats capable of sustaining life in harsh environments.\n\nIn summary, while there are ambitious plans for space colonization by 2100, significant technological advancements and substantial funding are required to make these plans a reality.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/15hju4u/human_space_exploration_reach_beyond_mars_and_the/\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceflight/comments/16ms82p/where_will_spaceflight_be_in_2100/\n- https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20170001554/downloads/20170001554.pdf\n\n# Final Instructions\nGive a forecast on the question above following the below steps.

Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Mass Extinctions**: There have been five major mass extinctions in Earth's history, each resulting in the loss of a large number of species. These events occurred at the end of the Cretaceous (66 million years ago), Late Triassic (199 million years ago), End Permian (252 million years ago), Late Devonian (378 million years ago), and Late Ordovician (447 million years ago) periods.\n\n2. **Current Extinction Rate**: The current rate of species extinction is estimated to be up to 10,000 times higher than the natural, historical rate. This is largely driven by human activities such as habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change.\n\n3. **Species at Risk**: At least 15,000 species are currently threatened with extinction, out of an estimated eight million species on Earth.\n\n4. **Recent Extinctions**: Since the end of the last ice age, many species have gone extinct due to climate changes and human activities such as overhunting and habitat destruction. Industrialization has further accelerated extinction rates.\n\nThese points highlight the significant impact of human activities on species extinction rates and the need for conservation efforts to mitigate these effects.\n\nSources:\n- https://naturalhistory.si.edu/education/teaching-resources/paleontology/extinction-over-time\n- https://www.theworldcounts.com/challenges/planet-earth/forests-and-deserts/species-extinction-rate\n## Question: How has the human population size and distribution changed over the last century?\n  Answer: To provide context for the larger question of whether the world will end by 2100, let's examine how the human population size and distribution have changed over the last century.\n\n### Population Growth and Distribution\n\n- **Population Size**: The global population has grown significantly over the last century. In 1800, there were approximately one billion people, and today there are over eight billion.\n- **Growth Rate**: The population growth rate peaked in the 1960s at over 2% per year and has since declined to less than 1%. The UN projects that this decline will continue until the end of the century, with negative growth (population shrinkage) expected towards the end of the century.\n- **Peak Child**: The number of children under the age of five has peaked and is expected to decline in the coming decades.\n- **Regional Distribution**: By 2100, more than 8 out of 10 people in the world will live in Asia or Africa.\n\n### Impact of Climate Change\n\n- **Sea Level Rise**: Rising sea levels will significantly alter coastlines, making many cities uninhabitable and displacing hundreds of millions of people. Cities like London, New York, Bangkok, and others will be at risk of flooding.\n- **Climate Migration**: Climate change will lead to increased migration, food shortages, and the spread of infectious diseases due to more frequent and long-lasting heatwaves.\n\n### Habitability and Adaptation\n\n- **Habitability**: Despite the challenges posed by climate change, the Earth will still be habitable in 2100. Humans have adapted to extreme environments and will continue to do so, but the planet's habitability will be affected by rising temperatures, sea level rise, and ecosystem changes.\n\n### Sources\n\n- https://ourworldindata.org/population-growth\n- https://www.earth.com/news/how-will-the-world-look-in-2100-due-to-climate-change/\n- https://michigantoday.umich.edu/2021/06/25/will-the-earth-be-habitable-in-2100/\n## Question: What are the primary existential risks currently identified by experts?\n  Answer: In the context of the larger question 'Will the world end by 2100?', the primary existential risks currently identified by experts include:\n\n1. **Supervolcanic Eruptions**: These rare events have the potential to cause catastrophic global consequences, including widespread destruction of ecosystems, disruption of global agriculture, and long-term climate change. The most recent supereruption on record occurred at Indonesia's Toba Caldera approximately 74,000 years ago, which likely triggered a volcanic winter and significantly reduced the global human population.\n\n2. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Experts predict a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100 due to AI, while superforecasters put the odds at 1%. This risk is associated with the potential for AI to become uncontrollable and pose a threat to humanity.\n\n3. **Climate Change**: Climate change is considered an existential threat due to its potential to cause mass extinctions and disrupt human societies. Unchecked climate change could lead to global temperatures increasing by 4.5 degrees Celsius or more by 2100, which would have catastrophic consequences.\n\nThese risks are identified by experts in various fields, including volcanology, AI research, and climate science.\n\nSources:\n- https://globaia.org/risks\n- https://www.freethink.com/robots-ai/ai-predictions-superforecasters\n- https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/why-do-some-people-call-climate-change-existential-threat\n## Question: What probability do experts assign to existential risks such as nuclear war, climate change, pandemics, and artificial intelligence by 2100?\n  Answer: To provide a comprehensive answer to the question, I will break down the probabilities assigned to each of the mentioned existential risks by experts:\n\n1. **Nuclear War**:\n   - The probability of nuclear war is not explicitly stated in the provided sources. However, the context suggests that it is a significant risk, particularly in light of recent developments such as Russia's suspension of participation in a key nuclear arms reduction treaty with the United States.\n\n2. **Climate Change**:\n   - The probability of climate change causing an existential catastrophe is not directly stated. However, it is noted that climate change can be a driver for other risks that are existential.\n\n3. **Pandemics**:\n   - The probability of pandemics causing an existential catastrophe is not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that the impact of pandemics can be significant, especially if they are highly transmissible and deadly.\n\n4. **Artificial Intelligence**:\n   - Philosopher Toby Ord estimates a 1-in-6 risk of existential catastrophe by 2120, with 60% of this risk coming from misaligned AI, which translates to a 10% risk of existential catastrophe from misaligned AI by 2120.\n   - A 2021 survey of 44 researchers working on reducing existential risks from AI found the median risk estimate to be 32.5%.\n\nIn summary, while exact probabilities are not provided for all risks, the sources suggest that experts consider these risks significant and potentially existential. The most concrete probability estimates come from the context of AI, with a median risk estimate of 32.5% and a 10% risk of existential catastrophe from misaligned AI by 2120.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/existential-risk-whole-society-challenge\n- https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\n- https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iKLLSYHvnhgcpoBxH/the-precipice-revisited\n## Question: How has the frequency and severity of global catastrophic events changed over the last century?\n  Answer: To help the superforecaster make a better prediction, I have researched the frequency and severity of global catastrophic events over the last century. Here are the key findings:\n\n1. **Increase in Natural Disasters**:\n   - The number of natural disasters has increased tenfold since the 1960s. In 1960, there were 39 incidents, while in 2019, there were 396 incidents.\n   - The most common natural disasters are floods, which account for 42% of all disasters since 1990, followed by storms, which account for 30%.\n\n2. **Impact of Climate Change**:\n   - Climate change has increased the likelihood of weather-related natural disasters. Hotter global temperatures lead to more intense storms, wetter monsoons, and a higher risk of droughts.\n\n3. **Death Toll and Economic Costs**:\n   - On average, natural disasters kill 40,000 to 50,000 people per year, although single extreme events can cause tens to hundreds of thousands of deaths.\n   - The economic costs of these events can be severe, particularly in lower-income countries.\n\n4. **Resilience and Progress**:\n   - Despite the increase in disasters, deaths from disasters have fallen significantly over the last century due to early warning systems, better infrastructure, and coordinated responses.\n\nThese findings suggest that while the frequency and severity of global catastrophic events have increased, there has been progress in reducing the impact of these events through improved resilience measures.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.visionofhumanity.org/global-number-of-natural-disasters-increases-ten-times/\n- https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters\n## Question: What technological advancements are expected or predicted that could mitigate existential risks?\n  Answer: To mitigate existential risks by 2100, several technological advancements are expected or predicted:\n\n1. **Advances in Spaceflight, Manufacturing, Robotics, and Terraforming**: These advancements could enable humanity to spread permanently beyond Earth, making civilization more likely to endure.\n\n2. **Early Identification and Deflection of Asteroids**: Active research at NASA and elsewhere aims to identify incoming asteroids and develop methods to shift their paths, reducing the risk of catastrophic impacts.\n\n3. **Mitigation of Supervolcanic Eruptions**: While currently no techniques exist to prevent or mitigate supervolcanic eruptions, future advancements might make this possible, reducing the risk of global catastrophes.\n\n4. **Rewriting Biology and Climate Intervention**: It is expected that within this century, we will be able to rewrite much of biology and intervene in the global climate on a large scale, potentially mitigating risks such as engineered pandemics and extreme climate scenarios.\n\n5. **Artificial Intelligence**: While AI also poses risks, some predictions suggest that AI could be developed to help mitigate existential risks, such as by assisting in the detection and prevention of catastrophic events.\n\nThese technological advancements are crucial in reducing the likelihood of existential catastrophes and ensuring the long-term survival of humanity.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/articles/technological-wild-cards-existential-risk-and-a-changing-humanity/\n- https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\n## Question: What are the current trends in international cooperation and conflict?\n  Answer: To provide context for the larger question of whether the world will end by 2100, current trends in international cooperation and conflict are crucial. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Escalating Conflicts**:\n   - Wars are ongoing in Gaza, Sudan, and Ukraine, and peacemaking efforts are in crisis.\n   - The trend towards less armed conflict globally since the end of the Cold War is now reversing.\n\n2. **Regional Tensions**:\n   - Experts are concerned about the escalation of the Israel-Hamas war into a wider regional conflict.\n   - There is a growing risk of a U.S. military confrontation with China or Russia, particularly in the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.\n\n3. **Domestic Unrest**:\n   - The leading concern for foreign policy experts is the possibility of domestic terrorism and acts of political violence in the United States, particularly around the 2024 presidential election.\n\n4. **Migration and Economic Pressures**:\n   - A surge in migration to the southwest U.S. border is expected due to criminal violence, corruption, and economic hardship in Central America and Mexico.\n\nThese trends indicate that international cooperation is facing significant challenges, and the risk of conflict is increasing. This information was found in sources from the Crisis Group and the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/10-conflicts-watch-2024\n- https://www.cfr.org/report/conflicts-watch-2024\n## Question: How resilient are human societies to large-scale disruptions based on past events?\n  Answer: To assess the resilience of human societies to large-scale disruptions based on past events, we can draw insights from various studies and research.\n\n1. **Frequent Disturbances Enhanced Resilience**:\n   - Research published in _Nature_ on May 1, 2024, found that frequent disturbances in the past increased the resilience of human populations. This study analyzed evidence of global population change spanning 30,000 years and concluded that the frequency of disturbances played a significant role in enhancing the resilience of survivor populations.\n\n2. **Learning from Past Events**:\n   - The study suggests that experiencing disturbances leads to learning and preparation for future events. This learning process helps populations to better withstand and recover from challenges.\n\n3. **Impact of Land Use**:\n   - The research also found that land use choices significantly affect the ability to withstand and recover from disturbances. For example, farming and herding societies were more likely to experience population declines but were also more resilient overall.\n\n4. **Duration of Disturbances**:\n   - The study revealed that population crashes and recoveries in the past lasted for decades or centuries, with disturbances lasting a median average of 98 years.\n\n5. **Global Comparison**:\n   - This research is the first systematic global comparison of humans' ability to absorb and recover from disturbances through time, making it a landmark study in understanding long-term resilience.\n\nIn summary, human societies have shown resilience to large-scale disruptions in the past, with frequent disturbances enhancing this resilience. The ability to learn from past events and adapt to changing circumstances, as well as the impact of land use choices, are crucial factors in determining the resilience of human societies.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07354-8\n- https://www.dri.edu/frequent-disturbances-increased-the-resilience-of-past-human-populations/\n## Question: What are the predictions from major global risk assessment reports (e.g., Global Challenges Foundation, Future of Humanity Institute) regarding human extinction?\n  Answer: In the context of the larger question 'Will the world end by 2100?', the predictions from major global risk assessment reports regarding human extinction are as follows:\n\n- **Future of Humanity Institute (FHI) Survey (2008)**: The median extinction risk estimates from the survey include:\n  - Total killed by superintelligent AI: 5%\n  - Total killed in all nuclear wars: 1%\n  - Total killed in all acts of nuclear terrorism: 0.03%\n  - Overall risk of extinction prior to 2100: 19%\n\nThese estimates were based on an informal survey among participants at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference in Oxford in 2008.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/reports/2008-1.pdf\n## Question: What is the current state of research and development in human mind uploading or digital immortality?\n  Answer: The current state of research and development in human mind uploading or digital immortality is actively progressing, though significant hurdles remain. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Digital Immortality Definition**: Digital immortality involves preserving a person's consciousness or aspects of their identity in a digital form beyond their physical death. This includes uploading a person's mind or consciousness onto a computer or network, where it could potentially exist indefinitely.\n\n2. **Technological Hurdles**: There are four main technological hurdles to overcome: uploading consciousness, preserving personal data, developing advanced artificial intelligence, and speech-to-speech synthesis. While the latter three are achievable with current technology, uploading consciousness remains the major obstacle.\n\n3. **Mind Uploading Approaches**: One promising technique is the \"scan and copy\" method, where detailed scans of a preserved brain are used to reproduce a person's biological brain in a computer. This could potentially allow for whole-brain emulation and mind uploading.\n\n4. **Neurotechnology Advancements**: Rapid progress in neurotechnology, such as brain-to-computer interfaces and implantable devices, is allowing for better deciphering of brain waves and potentially modifying the brain. This could contribute to the development of mind uploading technology.\n\n5. **Predictions and Timelines**: Some experts predict that mind uploading could become a reality by 2045, though this timeline is considered optimistic by some. Others believe it could take 100 years or more to achieve.\n\n6. **Ethical and Societal Implications**: The concept of digital immortality raises profound ethical and societal questions, including the potential for misuse and the need to reevaluate what it means to be human. It also poses challenges for theological morality and the concept of an afterlife.\n\nSources:\n- https://atos.net/advancing-what-matters/en/blog/digital-immortality\n- https://theconversation.com/how-uploading-our-minds-to-a-computer-might-become-possible-206804\n- https://bigthink.com/the-well/will-humanity-become-digitally-immortal/\n## Question: How has the global investment in and focus on existential risk reduction changed over recent years?\n  Answer: The global investment in and focus on existential risk reduction have undergone significant changes over recent years. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Increased Awareness and Concern**: The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report 2024 highlights that the majority of respondents (54%) anticipate some instability and a moderate risk of global catastrophes in the short term, while another 27% expect greater turbulence. This increased awareness and concern about global risks have led to a greater focus on existential risk reduction.\n\n2. **Cost-of-Living Crisis**: The Global Risks Report 2023 ranked the \"cost-of-living crisis\" as the most severe global risk over the next two years, peaking in the short term. This crisis has likely shifted some focus towards immediate economic and social challenges, potentially diverting attention from long-term existential risks.\n\n3. **Biodiversity Loss and Environmental Risks**: The Global Risks Report 2023 also emphasized biodiversity loss and environmental risks as significant concerns. This increased focus on environmental issues might have led to more investment in mitigating these risks, which are closely tied to existential risks.\n\n4. **Technological Risks**: The Global Risks Report 2024 mentions AI-generated misinformation and disinformation as a significant risk, with 53% of respondents selecting it as a top risk for 2024. This growing concern about technological risks, including AI, has likely led to increased investment in mitigating these risks.\n\n5. **Forecasting and Prediction**: The Metaculus platform, which focuses on predicting future events, has seen increased activity and discussion around existential risks. For example, a Metaculus Pro Forecaster, Jared Leibowich, has emphasized the importance of creativity in forecasting and has explored the potential for sentient AI to be granted legal rights by 2035. This increased discussion and forecasting around existential risks indicates a growing focus on these issues.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2023/digest/\n- https://www.weforum.org/publications/global-risks-report-2024/in-full/responding-to-global-risks/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/17507/seeing-the-future-through-fiction-how-to-harness-your-creativity-for-forecasting/\n- https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_The_Global_Risks_Report_2024.pdf\n## Question: What are the trends in global political stability and governance?\n  Answer: To provide insights on trends in global political stability and governance in the context of the larger question \"Will the world end by 2100?\", several key points can be highlighted:\n\n1. **Rise in Political Polarization and Inequality**: The article from Population Connection notes that global inequality and political polarization are on the rise, which does not bode well for the resilience of modern societies. This trend could contribute to societal collapse if not addressed.\n\n2. **Impact of Elections and Political Instability**: Control Risks highlights that 2024 will see over 40 parliamentary and presidential elections, which could lead to political instability and changes in governance. The US elections in November 2024 are particularly significant, as they may impact geopolitical risk throughout the year.\n\n3. **Geopolitical Regulatory Competition**: Control Risks also notes that geopolitical events will continue to motivate both transnational and homegrown terrorist activity, posing challenges to government security services and corporate security managers.\n\n4. **Environmental Activism and Governance**: Climate-related activism is expected to increase in 2024, with perceived inaction on climate commitments by governments and companies likely to lead to more protests and targeted actions. This could impact governance and political stability.\n\n5. **Global Economic Resilience**: The global economic outlook will be impacted by geopolitical trends, including regional conflicts, sanctions, and more protectionist trade policies. This could lead to political stability and unrest risks.\n\nThese trends suggest that global political stability and governance are facing significant challenges, which could contribute to the likelihood of societal collapse by 2100.\n\nSources:\n- https://populationconnection.org/blog/are-we-nearing-global-collapse/\n- https://www.metaculus.com\n- https://www.theguardian.com/music/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jan/29/if-the-world-ends-in-2100-were-probably-ok\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://www.controlrisks.com/our-thinking/insights/ten-global-topics-and-trends-to-watch-in-2024\n## Question: What are the predictions of long-term survival from experts in fields like futurology, risk analysis, and global security?\n  Answer: To provide insights on long-term survival predictions from experts in fields like futurology, risk analysis, and global security, I have gathered information from various sources:\n\n1. **Metaculus Community Forecasts**:\n   - The Metaculus community has forecasted the global population in 2122 to be around 8 or 9 billion, with a possibility of reaching 20 billion due to technological and economic advancements.\n\n2. **Pew Research Center**:\n   - Experts predict significant changes for the worse in the next five years, including the rise of totalitarian measures, economic depression, and the breakdown of society and supply chains.\n\n3. **Atlantic Council Survey**:\n   - A survey of 167 experts predicts a high likelihood of global economic crises and pandemics by 2033, with 76% expecting another global economic crisis and 49% foreseeing another global pandemic.\n\n4. **Humane Future of Work**:\n   - The world in 2100 is expected to be hotter, more populous, and technologically advanced, with a different world order and potentially less or no work.\n\nThese predictions highlight the uncertainty and potential risks associated with long-term survival, including the impact of climate change, economic instability, and technological advancements.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/14965/forecasting-our-world-in-data-the-next-100-years/\n- https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/02/18/worries-about-life-in-2025/\n- https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/atlantic-council-strategy-paper-series/welcome-to-2033/\n- https://humanefutureofwork.com/what-will-the-world-be-like-in-2100/\n## Question: What are the estimates for the probability of accidental or deliberate use of weapons of mass destruction in the next century?\n  Answer: To provide estimates for the probability of accidental or deliberate use of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in the next century, we need to consider various factors and sources.\n\n### Accidental Use\n\n- **Nuclear Accidents**: The risk of nuclear accidents is a significant concern. For instance, the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011 demonstrate the potential for catastrophic consequences. These events highlight the importance of safety measures and international cooperation to prevent such incidents.\n\n### Deliberate Use\n\n- **Deliberate Events (DEs)**: The World Health Organization (WHO) defines DEs as malicious acts intended to cause harm, including the use of chemical, biological, and radiological agents. These events can have significant health and security implications, and the WHO works to prevent and respond to such incidents.\n- **Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs)**: NATO is actively working to prevent the proliferation of WMDs through arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation efforts.\n- **Dual-Use Research**: Scientific advances in fields like gene editing and reconstruction can lead to the creation of new pathogens, increasing the risk of deliberate use of WMDs.\n\n### Probability Estimates\n\n- **Metaculus Predictions**: While there are no specific predictions on Metaculus for the probability of accidental or deliberate use of WMDs by 2100, the platform allows users to make predictions and aggregate collective wisdom on various topics, including global events and risks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nEstimating the probability of accidental or deliberate use of WMDs in the next century is a complex task. It involves considering various factors such as nuclear safety, deliberate events, and the proliferation of WMDs. While there are no specific probability estimates available, the risks associated with these events are well-documented, and international efforts are underway to mitigate them.\n\n**Sources:**\n- https://www.metaculus.com\n- https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deliberate-events\n- https://www.metaculus.com/questions/605/how-much-global-warming-by-2100/\n- https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/occasional/cswmd/CSWMD_OccationalPaper-8.pdf\n- https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_50325.htm\n## Question: What are the latest developments in space colonization and its feasibility by 2100?\n  Answer: The latest developments in space colonization and its feasibility by 2100 indicate that significant advancements are needed to achieve human exploration and settlement beyond Mars and the asteroid belts. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Human Exploration Beyond Mars**:\n   - By 2100, there is a possibility of having science outposts on the Moon and Mars, with a thriving Earth orbit economy focused on observation and other activities.\n   - Some predict that colonies might be established on the Moon and Mars, and possibly even in the Asteroid Belt or Jupiter/Saturn's moons.\n\n2. **Propulsion Technology**:\n   - Dramatic improvements in space propulsion are required for manned spaceflight to Jupiter, Saturn, and the outer gas planets. Nuclear thermal/electric propulsion could help reduce travel time, but the development of fusion propulsion and advanced drives like the Epstein drive would be necessary for more rapid travel.\n\n3. **Challenges and Funding**:\n   - The main obstacle to progress is not technology but funding. The Apollo program's success was largely driven by the Cold War, and similar motivations are needed to drive investment in space exploration.\n   - The development of advanced propulsion technologies, such as fusion, is contingent on significant funding, which has been lacking in recent years.\n\n4. **Economic Viability**:\n   - For space colonization to be economically viable, there needs to be a compelling business case. Currently, the main customers are on Earth, so selling products or services to Earth-based customers is necessary to justify the costs of deep space operations.\n\n5. **NASA's Strategy**:\n   - NASA has outlined a strategy for human exploration of the solar system by 2100, which involves the development of advanced propulsion technologies, such as nuclear-based propulsion, and space habitats capable of sustaining life in harsh environments.\n\nIn summary, while there are ambitious plans for space colonization by 2100, significant technological advancements and substantial funding are required to make these plans a reality.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/15hju4u/human_space_exploration_reach_beyond_mars_and_the/\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/spaceflight/comments/16ms82p/where_will_spaceflight_be_in_2100/\n- https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20170001554/downloads/20170001554.pdf\n\n# FORECASTS\n## Reasoning from forecaster 0\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - [Metaculus] Metaculus questions resolve positively 41% of the time\n  - [Future of Humanity Institute Survey, 2008] Overall risk of extinction prior to 2100: 19%\n  - [Toby Ord] 1-in-6 risk of existential catastrophe by 2120: 16.67%\n  - [Superforecasters] Experts predict a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100 due to AI\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.19\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: The most appropriate base rate is 19% from the Future of Humanity Institute Survey, as it directly estimates the overall risk of human extinction before 2100, which aligns closely with the question's resolution criteria.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - [Superforecasters] Experts predict a 6% chance of human extinction by 2100 due to AI\n  - [Toby Ord] 1-in-6 risk of existential catastrophe by 2120, with 60% of this risk coming from misaligned AI\n  - [WHO] Deliberate events involving WMDs, including chemical, biological, and radiological agents, pose significant risks\n  - [Crisis Group and Council on Foreign Relations] Escalating conflicts and risk of U.S. military confrontation with China or Russia\n\n**Cons**: \n  - [Nature Study, 2024] Frequent disturbances have increased the resilience of human societies over 30,000 years\n  - [Our World in Data] Despite challenges, human societies have shown the ability to adapt and thrive, with improved resilience measures\n  - [NASA Strategy] Advancements in space colonization could increase the long-term survival of humanity\n  - [BBVA OpenMind] Technological advancements, such as space colonization and rewriting biology, could mitigate existential risks\n\n**Reasoning**: Starting with the chosen base rate of 19% from the Future of Humanity Institute, I will consider the pros and cons. The 6% chance of AI-related extinction and the risk of deliberate use of WMDs are significant existential threats, but they are already captured in the chosen base rate. The escalating conflicts and geopolitical instability also add weight to the positive resolution. However, the resilience of human societies as demonstrated by past events, advances in technology, and potential for space colonization should reduce the probability of extinction. Given the balanced nature of the pros and cons, I will make a slight downward adjustment to account for human resilience and technological advancements, adjusting the base rate down by 3% to 16% (0.16).\n\n**Prediction**: 16.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 1\n**Possible Base Rates**:\n  - Historical mass extinction events (5 in over 500 million years) suggest a very low base rate of total extinction events on a geological timescale.\n  - Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute (2008) estimates a 19% overall risk of human extinction by 2100.\n  - Metaculus average resolution rate of 41% for questions resolving positively.\n  - Toby Ord's estimate of a 1-in-6 (approximately 16.67%) risk of existential catastrophe by 2120.\n\n**Chosen Base Rate**: 0.19\n\n**Chosen Base Rate Explanation**: The most appropriate base rate is the 19% estimate for human extinction by 2100 from Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute. This is because it specifically addresses the overall risk of human extinction by a similar timeframe and aggregates expert opinions on various existential risks.\n\n**Aggregated Information**: NOTHING FOUND\n\n**Pros**:\n  - Existential risks such as AI, climate change, nuclear war, and pandemics all pose significant threats.\n  - Increased frequency and severity of natural disasters due to climate change.\n  - Technological advancements like AI could potentially lead to uncontrollable scenarios if misaligned.\n\n**Cons**: \n  - Human societies have shown resilience to large-scale disruptions in the past.\n  - Technological advancements in risk mitigation, such as asteroid deflection and climate intervention, are expected.\n  - Global efforts and investments in existential risk reduction have increased.\n  - Predictions show continued habitability of Earth despite challenges posed by climate change.\n\n**Reasoning**: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 19% from Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute.

Many of India's conventional and nuclear-powered submarines have been supplied by [Russia/USSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_submarines_of_the_Indian_Navy).  The only nuclear submarine in India's Navy as of June 2022 is the Indian-built [INS Arihant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INS_Arihant).\n\nIn [September 2021](https://www.indiatoday.in/india-today-insight/story/why-the-us-won-t-give-india-nuclear-submarines-1854818-2021-09-20), the US, UK, and Australia made an agreement to design and build 8 nuclear submarines for Australia's navy.  Former Indian naval chief Arun Prakash [commented](https://archive.ph/WR4oJ#selection-1101.1-1109.101), \"For years, the US has been telling India that American laws make it impossible to share nuclear-propulsion tech with anyone, including allies.\"  Srinath Raghavan, professor of international relations at Ashoka University [said](https://archive.ph/WR4oJ#selection-2383.1-2383.215) \"It\u2019s normal realpolitik, [...] The US gave short shrift to an ally like France in the process, [so] it would be silly of India to see this as a snub.\"",

        "explanation": "\n# Questions and Answers:\n## Question: What is the historical precedent for the US sharing nuclear submarine technology with other countries?\n  Answer: The historical precedent for the US sharing nuclear submarine technology with other countries is primarily seen in the case of the United Kingdom. In the late 1950s, the US and the UK signed the US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement, which allowed for the transfer of nuclear submarine technology from the US to the UK. This agreement facilitated the development of the UK's first nuclear-powered submarine, HMS *Dreadnought*, which was fitted with an American S5W reactor. This collaboration also led to the UK's development of its own nuclear propulsion system, with Rolls-Royce working closely with the UK Atomic Energy Authority. This technology sharing was significant, as it marked a key instance of cooperation between the two nations in the field of nuclear submarine technology.\n## Question: Has the US ever offered nuclear submarines to non-NATO allies?\n  Answer: Yes, the United States has offered nuclear submarines to non-NATO allies. Specifically, the AUKUS submarine deal involves the sale of Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines to Australia, which is a major non-NATO ally.\n## Question: How often has the US made new military agreements with India in the past decade?\n  Answer: To provide an accurate answer to the question about the frequency of new military agreements between the US and India in the past decade, we can rely on the information from the provided sources.\n\n1. **Foundational Agreements**:\n   - The US and India concluded two additional foundational defense agreements between 2016 and 2020, which aimed to enhance logistics support and interoperability.\n\n2. **Defense Technology and Trade Initiative (DTTI)**:\n   - The DTTI was launched in 2012 to promote defense trade and technology cooperation. Under this initiative, the US and India agreed to pursue four pathfinder projects, including cooperation on aircraft carriers and jet engine technology.\n\n3. **Recent Developments**:\n   - In June 2023, India and the US launched the Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X) to expand strategic technology and defense industrial cooperation. This included a proposal for joint production of the F414 jet engine in India and the approval of the purchase of armed MQ-9B SeaGuardian and SkyGuardian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).\n\nBased on these sources, we can conclude that the US and India have made significant progress in their military cooperation over the past decade, with multiple agreements and initiatives aimed at enhancing defense ties, technology sharing, and joint production.\n## Question: What are the current geopolitical relationships between the US and India?\n  Answer: The current geopolitical relationships between the US and India are characterized by a mix of cooperation and tension. Here are some key points:\n\n1. **Strategic Partnership**: The US and India are strengthening their strategic partnership, particularly in the context of countering China's growing influence. They share a common goal of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific region.\n\n2. **Defense Cooperation**: The two countries are enhancing defense cooperation, including co-production of defense equipment and joint exercises. The US aims to help India become a premier naval force and logistics hub in the Indian Ocean.\n\n3. **Economic Ties**: The US and India have significant economic ties, with the US being India's largest trading partner. India has been increasing its engagement with other nations, including the UK and European countries, but the US remains a crucial partner.\n\n4. **Climate Policy**: There are differences in climate policy, with India pushing for more burden sharing by developed countries.

This initiative is expected to drive further high-level meetings and negotiations between defense officials from both countries.\n\nThese scheduled meetings and dialogues indicate that there will be ongoing high-level engagement between U.S. and Indian defense officials before September 2024.\n## Question: What is the current level of dependency of India on Russian military hardware, and is there a visible trend to reduce this dependency?\n  Answer: The current level of dependency of India on Russian military hardware is significant, but there is a visible trend to reduce this dependency.\n\nHistorically, India has relied heavily on Russian weapons and equipment for its armed forces. Russia has supplied approximately 65% of India's weapons purchases over the last two decades, amounting to more than $60 billion. The Indian Army, Navy, and Air Force have inventories featuring several Russian weapon systems, including T-72 and T-90 main battle tanks, BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles, BM-21 and BM-30 Smerch multiple rocket-launch systems, and various air defense systems.\n\nHowever, the ongoing war in Ukraine has accelerated India's efforts to reduce its dependence on Russian military hardware. India has taken steps to modernize its military and diversify its defense acquisition partnerships. In 2023, India conducted sea trials for its first domestically produced aircraft carrier and negotiated with several Western countries for the transfer of key defense technologies. The \"Make in India\" initiative, launched in 2014, aims to develop the country's defense industry and reduce reliance on imports.\n\nRecent developments indicate a shift away from Russian arms. India has canceled or ended negotiations on several weapon system acquisitions from Russia due to logistical delivery issues. The country is now looking beyond Russia for defense imports, with a potential opening for Western arms manufacturers. India has also been strengthening partnerships with other countries, such as the Philippines, and deepening cooperation with the US, Australia, France, and Japan.\n\nIn summary, while India still relies significantly on Russian military hardware, there is a clear trend towards reducing this dependency through indigenous production and diversification of defense partnerships.\n## Question: How have recent global events (e.g., Russia-Ukraine conflict) impacted India's military procurement policies?\n  Answer: Recent global events, particularly the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have significantly impacted India's military procurement policies. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Shift Away from Russian Dependence**:\n   - The ongoing conflict has compelled India to reduce its reliance on Russian military capabilities. This shift is driven by the need to diversify its military supplies and avoid being overly dependent on a single supplier, especially given the growing Sino-Russian ties.\n   - India has already cancelled or put on hold several orders for Russian equipment, such as MiG-29 fighters and Mi-17 helicopters, and is actively seeking alternative suppliers.\n\n2. **Indigenization Efforts**:\n   - The Indian government has accelerated its \"Aatmanirbhar Bharat\" (self-reliant India) initiative, aiming to indigenize military production and reduce external dependencies. This includes efforts to develop and procure more domestic weapon systems, such as the Light Combat Helicopters and Light Combat Aircraft Mk 1A from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).\n   - The government has also set ambitious targets for domestic production, including a goal of producing INR 1,750 billion (US$26 billion) worth of defence equipment by 2025, with INR 350 billion (US$5 billion) in exports.\n\n3. **Increased Focus on Domestic Industry**:\n   - The Indian Ministry of Defence has earmarked a significant portion of its capital procurement budget for domestic industry, with Rs one lakh crore (approximately US$13.5 billion) allocated for domestic procurement in FY 2023-24.\n   - The government has also taken steps to promote domestic production through initiatives like the \"Make in India\" program and the \"Make-II\" scheme, which encourages indigenous manufacturing.\n\n4. **Challenges and Limitations**:\n   - Despite these efforts, India still faces significant challenges in achieving self-reliance in defence production. The country's defence budget allocation remains below the desired 2.5 to 3 percent of GDP, and the budget utilization has been inconsistent, leading to delays and inefficiencies in the procurement process.\n   - The quality and timeliness of indigenous production have also been issues, with delays and high prices affecting the effectiveness of the \"Aatmanirbhar Bharat\" initiative.\n\nIn summary, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has accelerated India's efforts to diversify its military supplies, reduce dependence on Russia, and promote domestic production. While significant progress has been made, India still faces challenges in achieving its goals of self-reliance in defence production.\n## Question: How important are nuclear submarines for India's current naval strategy and security objectives?\n  Answer: Nuclear submarines play a crucial role in India's current naval strategy and security objectives. Here are key points highlighting their significance:\n\n1. **Deterrent Capability**: Nuclear submarines are seen as a key component of India's nuclear triad, providing a secure second-strike capability. This enhances India's deterrent power, particularly against China, which is considered the primary motivation for the nuclear submarine program.\n\n2. **Sea-Based Deterrent**: The Arihant-class submarines, which are nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, are designed to provide a sea-based deterrent. This capability is critical for India's security, as it allows for a more reliable and survivable nuclear deterrent compared to land-based systems.\n\n3. **Naval Superiority**: The development of nuclear submarines is part of India's broader strategy to enhance its naval superiority. This includes the ability to project power and maintain a presence in key regions such as the Indian Ocean and the Strait of Malacca.\n\n4. **Counter to Chinese Incursion**: India's naval strategy focuses on countering potential Chinese incursions into the Indian Ocean. Nuclear submarines are seen as a vital component in this strategy, providing a strong deterrent against Chinese aggression.\n\n5. **Long-Term Strategy**: The development of nuclear submarines is a long-term investment in India's naval capabilities. The country plans to build a fleet of at least six nuclear-powered attack submarines, which will significantly enhance its naval power projection capabilities.\n\n6. **International Influence**: The possession of nuclear submarines is seen as a symbol of India's growing international influence and its aspirations for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.\n\nIn summary, nuclear submarines are a critical component of India's naval strategy, providing a deterrent capability, enhancing naval superiority, and countering potential Chinese aggression. They are also seen as a symbol of India's growing international influence.\n\n# Forecasts\n## Reasoning from forecaster 0:\n The historical precedent for the US sharing nuclear submarine technology is limited primarily to the UK. Although the AUKUS agreement shows a willingness to extend nuclear submarine technology to non-NATO allies, such as Australia, this case is special due to the shared strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific region. Regulatory hurdles like the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), combined with strategic divergences and historical refusal to share such sensitive technology with India, present significant barriers. There have been no official statements or leaks suggesting a potential agreement between the US and India regarding nuclear submarines. Additionally, India's ongoing efforts to reduce its dependency on Russian military hardware and focus on indigenous production suggests a strategic shift, but not necessarily mutual compatibility with US nuclear tech sharing policies. Overall, while the US-India military cooperation is deepening, the specific scenario of a nuclear submarine offer appears highly improbable before the given date. \n Prediction: 0.05\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 1:\n Based on the given information, several factors suggest that it is unlikely for the US to offer India a nuclear submarine by September 30, 2024. Historical precedent indicates that the US has primarily shared nuclear propulsion technology with the UK, a close NATO ally, under very specific agreements. The new AUKUS agreement with Australia is a rarity and does not constitute a typical case. Export control laws pose significant regulatory hurdles, and there is no evidence of a shift in these laws that would make sharing such sensitive technology with India easier. Furthermore, recent developments in US-India defense cooperation and India\u2019s efforts to reduce dependence on Russian military hardware do not explicitly indicate any steps towards nuclear submarine technology sharing. Additionally, there have been no official statements or leaks suggesting such an agreement is imminent. Therefore, the base case remains that the US has not shared nuclear propulsion technology easily in the past and there are several barriers to doing so with India specifically. \n Prediction: 0.05\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 2:\n Despite the strengthening of US-India defense ties, historical and legal precedents, such as the Arms Export Control Act and ITAR, pose significant regulatory hurdles to sharing nuclear submarine technology. India's continued reliance on Russian military hardware and recent geopolitical tensions further complicate this scenario. While there have been significant improvements in US-India military cooperation and technological sharing, no official statements or leaks indicate an impending nuclear submarine agreement. India is also focusing on diversifying its defense acquisitions and enhancing indigenous capabilities. All these factors combined make the likelihood of the US offering India a nuclear submarine before September 30, 2024 minimal. \n Prediction: 0.05\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 3:\n Despite the growing military cooperation between the US and India, multiple factors significantly reduce the likelihood of the US offering India a nuclear submarine before September 2024. The US regulatory hurdles, historical resistance, and lack of official statements or leaks suggesting a potential agreement indicate that such a move is highly improbable. The recent push for defense innovation and strategic defense partnerships, while strengthening US-India relations, have not specifically mentioned nuclear submarines. Current trends show that India is focusing on indigenizing its defense capabilities and looking toward partnerships with other countries like France for its submarine needs. Such multinational agreements are complex, often taking years to negotiate and finalize, making a formal agreement before September 2024 unlikely. \n Prediction: 0.05\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 4:\n There are significant barriers to the US offering nuclear submarines to India, including regulatory hurdles related to the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the historical stance of the US on sharing nuclear propulsion technology, and strategic divergences. While recent developments show strong defense cooperation between the US and India, including high-level meetings and defense trade, there have been no official statements or leaks suggesting a potential agreement for nuclear submarines. Additionally, the US has been cautious in sharing nuclear submarine technology even with close allies, and India's ongoing shift toward self-reliance and diversifying its military suppliers suggests it may not be actively seeking nuclear submarines from the US. Given these factors, the likelihood of the US offering a nuclear submarine to India before September 30, 2024, is low. \n Prediction: 0.05\n",

This includes efforts to develop and procure more domestic weapon systems, such as the Light Combat Helicopters and Light Combat Aircraft Mk 1A from Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL).\n   - The government has also set ambitious targets for domestic production, including a goal of producing INR 1,750 billion (US$26 billion) worth of defence equipment by 2025, with INR 350 billion (US$5 billion) in exports.\n\n3. **Increased Focus on Domestic Industry**:\n   - The Indian Ministry of Defence has earmarked a significant portion of its capital procurement budget for domestic industry, with Rs one lakh crore (approximately US$13.5 billion) allocated for domestic procurement in FY 2023-24.\n   - The government has also taken steps to promote domestic production through initiatives like the \"Make in India\" program and the \"Make-II\" scheme, which encourages indigenous manufacturing.\n\n4. **Challenges and Limitations**:\n   - Despite these efforts, India still faces significant challenges in achieving self-reliance in defence production. The country's defence budget allocation remains below the desired 2.5 to 3 percent of GDP, and the budget utilization has been inconsistent, leading to delays and inefficiencies in the procurement process.\n   - The quality and timeliness of indigenous production have also been issues, with delays and high prices affecting the effectiveness of the \"Aatmanirbhar Bharat\" initiative.\n\nIn summary, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has accelerated India's efforts to diversify its military supplies, reduce dependence on Russia, and promote domestic production. While significant progress has been made, India still faces challenges in achieving its goals of self-reliance in defence production.\n## Question: How important are nuclear submarines for India's current naval strategy and security objectives?\n  Answer: Nuclear submarines play a crucial role in India's current naval strategy and security objectives. Here are key points highlighting their significance:\n\n1. **Deterrent Capability**: Nuclear submarines are seen as a key component of India's nuclear triad, providing a secure second-strike capability. This enhances India's deterrent power, particularly against China, which is considered the primary motivation for the nuclear submarine program.\n\n2. **Sea-Based Deterrent**: The Arihant-class submarines, which are nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines, are designed to provide a sea-based deterrent. This capability is critical for India's security, as it allows for a more reliable and survivable nuclear deterrent compared to land-based systems.\n\n3. **Naval Superiority**: The development of nuclear submarines is part of India's broader strategy to enhance its naval superiority. This includes the ability to project power and maintain a presence in key regions such as the Indian Ocean and the Strait of Malacca.\n\n4. **Counter to Chinese Incursion**: India's naval strategy focuses on countering potential Chinese incursions into the Indian Ocean. Nuclear submarines are seen as a vital component in this strategy, providing a strong deterrent against Chinese aggression.\n\n5. **Long-Term Strategy**: The development of nuclear submarines is a long-term investment in India's naval capabilities. The country plans to build a fleet of at least six nuclear-powered attack submarines, which will significantly enhance its naval power projection capabilities.\n\n6. **International Influence**: The possession of nuclear submarines is seen as a symbol of India's growing international influence and its aspirations for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.\n\nIn summary, nuclear submarines are a critical component of India's naval strategy, providing a deterrent capability, enhancing naval superiority, and countering potential Chinese aggression. They are also seen as a symbol of India's growing international influence.\n\n# Forecasts\n## Reasoning from forecaster 0:\n The historical precedent for the US sharing nuclear submarine technology is limited primarily to the UK. Although the AUKUS agreement shows a willingness to extend nuclear submarine technology to non-NATO allies, such as Australia, this case is special due to the shared strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific region. Regulatory hurdles like the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), combined with strategic divergences and historical refusal to share such sensitive technology with India, present significant barriers. There have been no official statements or leaks suggesting a potential agreement between the US and India regarding nuclear submarines. Additionally, India's ongoing efforts to reduce its dependency on Russian military hardware and focus on indigenous production suggests a strategic shift, but not necessarily mutual compatibility with US nuclear tech sharing policies. Overall, while the US-India military cooperation is deepening, the specific scenario of a nuclear submarine offer appears highly improbable before the given date. \n Prediction: 0.05\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 1:\n Based on the given information, several factors suggest that it is unlikely for the US to offer India a nuclear submarine by September 30, 2024. Historical precedent indicates that the US has primarily shared nuclear propulsion technology with the UK, a close NATO ally, under very specific agreements. The new AUKUS agreement with Australia is a rarity and does not constitute a typical case. Export control laws pose significant regulatory hurdles, and there is no evidence of a shift in these laws that would make sharing such sensitive technology with India easier. Furthermore, recent developments in US-India defense cooperation and India\u2019s efforts to reduce dependence on Russian military hardware do not explicitly indicate any steps towards nuclear submarine technology sharing. Additionally, there have been no official statements or leaks suggesting such an agreement is imminent. Therefore, the base case remains that the US has not shared nuclear propulsion technology easily in the past and there are several barriers to doing so with India specifically. \n Prediction: 0.05\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 2:\n Despite the strengthening of US-India defense ties, historical and legal precedents, such as the Arms Export Control Act and ITAR, pose significant regulatory hurdles to sharing nuclear submarine technology. India's continued reliance on Russian military hardware and recent geopolitical tensions further complicate this scenario. While there have been significant improvements in US-India military cooperation and technological sharing, no official statements or leaks indicate an impending nuclear submarine agreement. India is also focusing on diversifying its defense acquisitions and enhancing indigenous capabilities. All these factors combined make the likelihood of the US offering India a nuclear submarine before September 30, 2024 minimal. \n Prediction: 0.05\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 3:\n Despite the growing military cooperation between the US and India, multiple factors significantly reduce the likelihood of the US offering India a nuclear submarine before September 2024. The US regulatory hurdles, historical resistance, and lack of official statements or leaks suggesting a potential agreement indicate that such a move is highly improbable. The recent push for defense innovation and strategic defense partnerships, while strengthening US-India relations, have not specifically mentioned nuclear submarines. Current trends show that India is focusing on indigenizing its defense capabilities and looking toward partnerships with other countries like France for its submarine needs. Such multinational agreements are complex, often taking years to negotiate and finalize, making a formal agreement before September 2024 unlikely. \n Prediction: 0.05\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 4:\n There are significant barriers to the US offering nuclear submarines to India, including regulatory hurdles related to the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the historical stance of the US on sharing nuclear propulsion technology, and strategic divergences. While recent developments show strong defense cooperation between the US and India, including high-level meetings and defense trade, there have been no official statements or leaks suggesting a potential agreement for nuclear submarines. Additionally, the US has been cautious in sharing nuclear submarine technology even with close allies, and India's ongoing shift toward self-reliance and diversifying its military suppliers suggests it may not be actively seeking nuclear submarines from the US. Given these factors, the likelihood of the US offering a nuclear submarine to India before September 30, 2024, is low. \n Prediction: 0.05\n\n"

            "background_info": "Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group, have escalated dramatically. Recently, Hezbollah launched over 200 rockets into Israel in retaliation for the killing of one of its senior commanders by an Israeli strike. This attack represents one of the largest confrontations in the ongoing conflict along the Lebanon-Israel border, with significant military actions taken by both sides. Israel responded with strikes on various towns in southern Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah's military structures.\n\nThe conflict, which intensified following the outbreak of war in Gaza, has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border and resulted in numerous casualties. Israel considers Hezbollah its most direct threat, estimating the group possesses an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles, including precision-guided ones. The international community, including the U.S. and France, is actively working to prevent these skirmishes from escalating into an all-out war that could impact the broader region. Despite diplomatic efforts, Israeli officials have indicated that they might decide to go to war in Lebanon if a diplomatic solution cannot be achieved.",

Hezbollah's leader has declared a new phase of conflict, with significant military actions and threats of major retaliation. Israel has responded with strikes on southern Lebanon, and both sides have engaged in tit-for-tat attacks. The situation is further complicated by broader regional tensions, with Iranian and Hezbollah leaders vowing retaliation for Israeli airstrikes that killed civilians in the Golan Heights. Israeli and U.S. officials anticipate imminent attacks from Hezbollah and Iran, raising fears of a wider war.\n\nRecent statements by Israeli officials indicate a high level of readiness to engage militarily if provoked, despite a preference to avoid conflict. Hezbollah's aggressive stance and threats of major retaliation increase the likelihood of escalation. The current situation on the ground in southern Lebanon is marked by significant hostilities and civilian impact, with increased use of advanced weaponry. The United States is preparing for a potential conflict involving Hezbollah, indicating a strategic alignment with Israel. However, international diplomatic efforts are ongoing to de-escalate the conflict, though their success remains uncertain.\n\n## Possible Base Rates\n- Israel has conducted three major ground invasions into Lebanon over the past 50 years: 1978, 1982, and 2006. This results in a base rate of 3/50 or 6% [S2.Q0]\n- Full-scale invasions following escalations with Hezbollah have occurred twice in the past 50 years: 1982 and 2006. This results in a base rate of 2/50 or 4% [S2.Q1]\n- Israel has a history of responding to significant provocations with military action, with a notable success rate of threats leading to invasions. This suggests a base rate of around 10% [S2.Q3]\n- The historical frequency of Israeli ground troop invasions in response to significant civilian displacement and casualties is approximately 6% [S2.Q6]\n\n## Pros\n- Recent statements by Israeli officials indicate a high level of readiness and willingness to engage militarily if provoked [S1.Q1]\n- Hezbollah's aggressive stance and threats of major retaliation increase the likelihood of escalation [S1.Q2]\n- The current situation on the ground in southern Lebanon is marked by significant hostilities and civilian impact, which historically has led to Israeli invasions [S1.Q3]\n- The U.S. is preparing for a potential conflict involving Hezbollah, indicating a strategic alignment with Israel [S1.Q5]\n- Israel has recently integrated new technologies and advanced systems into its military operations, enhancing its readiness for conflict [S1.Q6]\n\n## Cons\n- International diplomatic efforts are ongoing to de-escalate the conflict, though their success remains uncertain [S1.Q7]\n- Historical frequency of full-scale invasions following escalations with Hezbollah is relatively low [S2.Q1]\n- Recent escalations have not yet resulted in a ground invasion, indicating a possible shift in Israel's immediate military strategy [S2.Q5]\n- The U.S. and France are actively working to prevent the conflict from escalating into an all-out war [S1.Q5]\n\n## Weaknesses and possible improvements\n- *Over-reliance on historical base rates*: The chosen base rates may not fully account for the unique current geopolitical context. \"Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 6% because it aggregates all major ground invasions by Israel into Lebanon over the past 50 years, providing a broader historical context.\"\n- *Insufficient consideration of diplomatic efforts*: The impact of ongoing diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict may be underestimated. \"International diplomatic efforts are ongoing to de-escalate the conflict, though their success remains uncertain.\"\n- *Potential bias towards recent events*: The analysis may be overly influenced by recent escalations and statements, without sufficient weighting of long-term trends. \"Recent statements by Israeli officials indicate a high level of readiness and willingness to engage militarily if provoked.\"\n\n\n# S1: BACKGROUND QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS\n## Q0: What is the current state of the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah as of late August 2024?\nAnswer:\nAs of late August 2024, the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has significantly escalated.

Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant issued a stern warning, stating, \"Do not make a mistake. We do not want a war. But we are prepared to protect our civilians, our soldiers and our sovereignty\" \\[[2](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/9/israel-threatens-to-return-lebanon-to-stone-age-in-any-war-with-hezbollah#:~:text=The%20threat%20issued%20by%20Israeli%20Defence%20Minister%20Yoav%20Gallant%20on%20Tuesday%20comes%20after%20weeks%20of%20repeated%20skirmishes%20with%20the%20armed%20Iran-backed%20group%20on%20the%20border%20area%20between%20the%20two%20countries)\\]. This statement came after weeks of repeated skirmishes with Hezbollah along the border area between Israel and Lebanon. Gallant's comments underscore Israel's readiness to engage militarily if provoked, despite a preference to avoid conflict.\n\nAdditionally, Israel has accused Hezbollah of increased provocations, such as the erection of two tents in the disputed border area and new tensions around the divided border town of Ghajar \\[[4](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/9/israel-threatens-to-return-lebanon-to-stone-age-in-any-war-with-hezbollah#:~:text=Israel%20recently%20accused%20Hezbollah%20of%20increased%20provocations%2C%20such%20as%20the%20erection%20of%20two%20tents%20in%20the%20disputed%20border%20area)\\].

The Biden administration has been discussing with the parties the parameters of a longer-term agreement to increase stability along the border. One key principle supported by the U.S. is to have the Lebanese Armed Forces become the sole border force on Lebanon\u2019s side, thereby pushing Hezbollah forces away from the border with Israel. However, Israeli officials have sent mixed messages about the distance Hezbollah fighters would need to move north of the border to allow Israeli civilians to return to their communities in northern Israel \\[[2](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-lebanon-hezbollah-talks.html#:~:text=The%20Lebanese%20foreign%20minister%2C%20prime%20minister%20and%20speaker%20of%20Parliament%20have%20been%20acting%20as%20intermediaries%20for%20Hezbollah%2C%20according%20to%20a%20senior%20Lebanese%20official)\\]\\[[3](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/world/middleeast/israel-hamas-lebanon-hezbollah-talks.html#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20does%20not%20negotiate%20directly%20with%20Hezbollah%2C%20which%20it%20has%20designated%20a%20terrorist%20organization)\\].\n\nDespite these efforts, the likelihood of success remains uncertain. The U.S. does not negotiate directly with Hezbollah, which complicates the process, and there has been little progress so far.

This historical context is crucial for forecasting potential future invasions.\n## Q1: How often have escalations between Israel and Hezbollah led to full-scale invasions in the past?\nAnswer:\nEscalations between Israel and Hezbollah have led to full-scale invasions in the past, but such occurrences are relatively rare. The most notable instance was the 1982 invasion, known as \"Operation Peace for Galilee,\" where Israel invaded Lebanon with the stated aim of destroying the Palestine Liberation Organization's (PLO) military and political apparatus. This invasion led to significant military engagement and the eventual creation of Hezbollah \\[[2](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/17/beyond-hezbollah-the-history-of-tensions-between-lebanon-and-israel#:~:text=%201982%3A%20On%20June%206%2C%201982%2C%20Israel%20invaded%20Lebanon%20under%20the%20pretence%20of%20stopping%20PLO%20raids%20across%20its%20border)\\]\\[[11](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/iopt0807/9.htm#:~:text=In%201982%2C%20Israel%20launched%20a%20major%20invasion%20it%20called%20%E2%80%9COperation%20Peace%20for%20Galilee%E2%80%9D%20for%20the%20stated%20purpose%20of%20destroying%20the%20Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization%E2%80%99s%20military%20and%20political%20apparatus%20in%20Lebanon)\\]. \n\nAnother significant conflict was the 2006 Lebanon War, also known as the July War or the 33-Day War, which began after Hezbollah launched rockets at Israeli border towns and ambushed an Israeli military patrol. This conflict resulted in a large-scale military response from Israel, but it did not escalate to a full-scale invasion similar to that of 1982 \\[[9](https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/cobban-33-day-war/#:~:text=Neither%20of%20these%20protagonists%20craves%20violence%20for%20its%20own%20sake)\\]. \n\nOverall, while there have been multiple escalations and conflicts, full-scale invasions have been less frequent, with the 1982 invasion being the most prominent example.\n## Q2: How frequently have international diplomatic efforts successfully prevented a major conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in the past?\nAnswer:\nInternational diplomatic efforts have had some success in preventing major conflicts between Israel and Hezbollah in the past. One notable instance is the 1996 Israeli\u2013Lebanese Ceasefire Understanding, also known as the Grapes of Wrath Understandings. This informal agreement, brokered by the United States, ended the military conflict between Israel and Hezbollah by stipulating that both sides would cease cross-border attacks on civilian targets and refrain from launching attacks from civilian villages. A Monitoring Committee, including representatives from the US, France, Syria, Israel, and Lebanon, was established to oversee the implementation of the agreement \\[[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-Lebanese_Ceasefire_Understanding#:~:text=%20%20The%20Israeli%E2%80%93Lebanese%20Ceasefire%20Understanding%20%28also%20known%20as%20The%20Grapes%20of%20Wrath%20Understandings%20and%20the%20April%20Understanding%29%20was%20an%20informal%20written%20agreement%20between%20Israel%20and%20Hezbollah%2C%20reached%20through%20the%20diplomatic%20efforts%20of%20the%20US%2C%20which%20ended%20the%201996%20military%20conflict%20between%20the%20two%20sides)\\]\\[[12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli-Lebanese_Ceasefire_Understanding#:~:text=It%20was%20announced%20at%2018%3A00%20on%20April%2026%2C%201996)\\].\n\nAnother significant example is the unilateral withdrawal of Israeli forces from Southern Lebanon in 2000, which was carried out by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. Although this withdrawal was not the result of a direct diplomatic agreement with Hezbollah, it was influenced by broader diplomatic considerations, including failed peace talks with Syria. This move was seen by many as a victory for Hezbollah and has contributed to a relatively calm situation, despite ongoing tensions and occasional violations of ceasefire agreements \\[[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_17_Agreement#:~:text=In%202000%2C%20Israel%20withdrew%20from%20its%20foothold%20in%20South%20Lebanon)\\]\\[[10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Lebanon_conflict_(1985%E2%80%932000)#:~:text=%5D%20in%20Israel%20that%20the%20Security%20Zone%20was%20not%20permanent%2C%20but%20the%20Israeli%20government%20hoped%20that%20a%20withdrawal%20could%20be%20carried%20out%20in%20the%20context%20of%20a%20wider%20agreement%20with%20Syria%20and%2C%20by%20extension%2C%20Lebanon)\\].\n\nThese examples indicate that while diplomatic efforts have not always led to lasting peace, they have been effective in de-escalating specific conflicts and preventing immediate large-scale warfare.\n## Q3: What is the historical success rate of Israeli military threats leading to actual invasions?\nAnswer:\nThe historical success rate of Israeli military threats leading to actual invasions can be analyzed through several key instances. Israel has a history of using military threats and limited force strategies, which have sometimes escalated into full-blown wars. For example, the 1956 Suez Crisis, the 1967 Six-Day War, and the 1982 Lebanon War all followed periods of heightened military threats and tensions \\[[11](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-studies-an-anthology-israeli-military-strategy#:~:text=This%20has%20increased%20the%20strategic%20emphasis%20on%20preemptive%20strikes%2C%20as%20illustrated%20in%20the%201956%20and%201967%20general%20wars%2C%20the%201982%20and%202006%20Lebanon%20conflicts%20and%20the%20attacks%20against%20nuclear%20facilities%20in%20Iraq%20%281981%29%20and%20Syria%20%282008%29)\\]. Additionally, Israel's strategy often involves preemptive strikes to enhance deterrence capabilities, as seen in the 1981 attack on Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor and the 2007 strike on Syria's nuclear facility \\[[11](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-studies-an-anthology-israeli-military-strategy#:~:text=This%20has%20increased%20the%20strategic%20emphasis%20on%20preemptive%20strikes%2C%20as%20illustrated%20in%20the%201956%20and%201967%20general%20wars%2C%20the%201982%20and%202006%20Lebanon%20conflicts%20and%20the%20attacks%20against%20nuclear%20facilities%20in%20Iraq%20%281981%29%20and%20Syria%20%282008%29)\\].\n\nA quantitative analysis of Israeli military actions from 1949 to 2003 indicates that limited force strategies were occasionally used to foster escalation, and in some cases, mismanagement of these engagements led to larger conflicts \\[[8](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636410701547782#:~:text=The%20study%20is%20based%20on%20a%20historical%20survey%20of%20these%20policies%20and%20on%20quantitative%20analysis%20of%20a%20dataset%20of%20the%20use%20of%20limited%20force%20by%20Israel%20over%20the%201949%E2%80%932003%20period)\\]. This suggests that while not all military threats lead to invasions, there is a significant historical precedent for threats escalating into military action.\n\nIn summary, Israel's military threats have a notable historical success rate of leading to invasions, particularly when preemptive strikes and deterrence strategies are involved. This pattern is evident in several major conflicts and is supported by quantitative analysis of past military engagements \\[[8](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636410701547782#:~:text=The%20study%20is%20based%20on%20a%20historical%20survey%20of%20these%20policies%20and%20on%20quantitative%20analysis%20of%20a%20dataset%20of%20the%20use%20of%20limited%20force%20by%20Israel%20over%20the%201949%E2%80%932003%20period)\\]\\[[11](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/israel-studies-an-anthology-israeli-military-strategy#:~:text=This%20has%20increased%20the%20strategic%20emphasis%20on%20preemptive%20strikes%2C%20as%20illustrated%20in%20the%201956%20and%201967%20general%20wars%2C%20the%201982%20and%202006%20Lebanon%20conflicts%20and%20the%20attacks%20against%20nuclear%20facilities%20in%20Iraq%20%281981%29%20and%20Syria%20%282008%29)\\].\n## Q4: How often have major regional conflicts involving Israel been initiated after significant provocations or escalations by Hezbollah?\nAnswer:\nMajor regional conflicts involving Israel have often been initiated after significant provocations or escalations by Hezbollah. Notably, the 2006 Lebanon War was precipitated by a Hezbollah cross-border raid, which led to a full-scale conflict between Hezbollah paramilitary forces and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) \\[[14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Lebanon_War#:~:text=The%20principal%20parties%20were%20Hezbollah%20paramilitary%20forces%20and%20the%20Israel%20Defense%20Forces%20%28IDF%29)\\]. This conflict saw unprecedented Iranian military support to Hezbollah, highlighting the significant role of external provocations in escalating tensions.\n\nAdditionally, the formation of Hezbollah itself was a direct response to Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, which aimed to stop PLO raids but extended as far as Beirut, leading to the eventual departure of the PLO from Lebanon \\[[2](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/17/beyond-hezbollah-the-history-of-tensions-between-lebanon-and-israel#:~:text=%201982%3A%20On%20June%206%2C%201982%2C%20Israel%20invaded%20Lebanon%20under%20the%20pretence%20of%20stopping%20PLO%20raids%20across%20its%20border)\\].

This invasion followed a period of escalating conflict and resulted in significant Israeli military presence in Lebanon \\[[2](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/iopt0807/9.htm#:~:text=In%201982%2C%20Israel%20launched%20a%20major%20invasion%20it%20called%20%E2%80%9COperation%20Peace%20for%20Galilee%E2%80%9D%20for%20the%20stated%20purpose%20of%20destroying%20the%20Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization%E2%80%99s%20military%20and%20political%20apparatus%20in%20Lebanon)\\].\n\n2. **2006 Lebanon War**: The conflict began on July 12, 2006, after Hezbollah's cross-border attack and abduction of two Israeli soldiers. Despite initial hesitance, the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) eventually conducted a major ground offensive. This included doubling troops in Southern Lebanon and conducting large-scale operations in the Bekaa Valley \\[[3](https://www.haaretz.com/2007-01-23/ty-article/halutz-objected-to-ground-offensive-almost-until-end-of-war/0000017f-defb-df7c-a5ff-defb42710000#:~:text=A%20Haaretz%20probe%20in%20recent%20weeks%20has%20enabled%2C%20for%20the%20first%20time%2C%20a%20reconstruction%20of%20critical%20parts%20of%20the%20exchanges%20during%20a%20series%20of%20meetings%20headed%20by%20the%20chief%20of%20staff)\\]\\[[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_2006_Lebanon_War_(early_August)#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20%20timeline%20of%20the%202006%20Lebanon%20War%20%20during%20early%20August)\\]\\[[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_Military_Operations_in_the_2006_Lebanon_War#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20%20timeline%20%20of%20events%20related%20to%20the%20%202006%20Lebanon%20War%20)\\].\n\n3. **Recent Clashes**: In April 2023, following clashes at Al-Aqsa and subsequent rocket fire from Lebanon into Israel, there was no immediate large-scale ground invasion by Israel. Instead, the response was primarily through aerial bombardments and defensive measures \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Lebanon_border_clashes#:~:text=%22%20%20%20Hezbollah%20has%20fought%20many%20conflicts%20with%20Israel%20including%20the%20South%20Lebanon%20conflict%2C%20the%20Shebaa%20Farms%20conflict%2C%20and%20the%202006%20Lebanon%20War)\\]\\[[14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Lebanon_border_clashes#:~:text=%20Since%20the%201948%20Palestinian%20expulsion%20and%20flight%2C%20Palestinian%20refugees%20have%20had%20a%20presence%20in%20southern%20Lebanon%20and%20numerous%20refugee%20camps%20were%20established%2C%20which%20brought%20many%20Palestinian%20factions%20into%20south%20Lebanon%2C%20with%20it%20being%20often%20used%20as%20a%20center%20to%20launch%20rockets%20into%20northern%20Israel%2C%20The%20Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization%20was%20based%20in%20Lebanon%20after%20being%20expelled%20from%20Jordan%20they%20were%20involved%20in%20an%20insurgency%20until%20they%20were%20expelled%20to%20Tunis%20after%20the%201982%20Lebanon%20War)\\].\n\nIn summary, Israeli ground invasions have historically followed significant escalations and declarations of new phases of conflict by Hezbollah, as seen in the 1982 and 2006 conflicts. However, more recent escalations, such as those in 2023, have not yet resulted in a similar ground invasion, indicating a possible shift in Israel's immediate military strategy.\n## Q6: What is the historical frequency of Israeli ground troop invasions into Lebanon when significant civilian displacement and casualties have occurred?\nAnswer:\nThe historical frequency of Israeli ground troop invasions into Lebanon in response to significant civilian displacement and casualties can be summarized through key events:\n\n1. **1978 Invasion**: Following a commando attack by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) that resulted in many Israeli civilian casualties, Israel invaded Lebanon on March 14-15, 1978, occupying the southern part of the country except for the city of Tyre \\[[1](https://unifil.unmissions.org/unifil-background#:~:text=In%20the%20early%201970s%2C%20tension%20along%20the%20Israel-Lebanon%20border%20increased%2C%20especially%20after%20the%20relocation%20of%20Palestinian%20armed%20elements%20from%20Jordan%20to%20Lebanon)\\]\\[[15](https://unifil.unmissions.org/unifil-background#:~:text=On%2011%20March%201978%2C%20a%20commando%20attack%20in%20Israel%20resulted%20in%20many%20dead%20and%20wounded%20among%20the%20Israeli%20population%3B%20the%20Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization%20%28PLO%29%20claimed%20responsibility%20for%20that%20raid)\\].\n\n2. **1982 Invasion**: In response to attacks from Palestinian militants based in Lebanon, Israel launched \"Operation Peace for Galilee\" in 1982. This invasion led to extensive civilian casualties, particularly through aerial bombardments and the siege of Beirut. The United Nations called for an immediate withdrawal, but Israel continued to occupy large parts of Lebanon \\[[4](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/iopt0807/9.htm#:~:text=Israel%E2%80%99s%20aerial%20bombardments%20killed%20thousands%20of%20civilians%20as%20its%20forces%20laid%20siege%20to%20Beirut)\\]\\[[7](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/iopt0807/9.htm#:~:text=In%201982%2C%20Israel%20launched%20a%20major%20invasion%20it%20called%20%E2%80%9COperation%20Peace%20for%20Galilee%E2%80%9D%20for%20the%20stated%20purpose%20of%20destroying%20the%20Palestine%20Liberation%20Organization%E2%80%99s%20military%20and%20political%20apparatus%20in%20Lebanon)\\]\\[[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_occupation_of_Southern_Lebanon#:~:text=The%20Israeli%20occupation%20of%20Southern%20Lebanon%20formally%20began%20in%201985%20and%20ended%20in%202000%20as%20part%20of%20the%20South%20Lebanon%20conflict)\\].\n\n3. **2006 Conflict**: The 2006 Lebanon War, triggered by Hezbollah's cross-border raid and rocket attacks, saw significant Israeli ground operations in Lebanon. This conflict resulted in substantial civilian displacement and casualties, with Israel conducting extensive military operations in southern Lebanon \\[[4](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/iopt0807/9.htm#:~:text=Israel%E2%80%99s%20aerial%20bombardments%20killed%20thousands%20of%20civilians%20as%20its%20forces%20laid%20siege%20to%20Beirut)\\]\\[[11](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2007/iopt0807/9.htm#:~:text=The%20United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20issued%20resolutions%20calling%20for%20a%20total%2C%20immediate%20and%20unconditional%20withdrawal%20of%20troops%20from%20Lebanon)\\].\n\nThese invasions were typically in response to significant provocations involving civilian casualties and displacement, often linked to militant activities against Israel. The pattern suggests that Israel has historically responded to such provocations with ground invasions, particularly when the attacks resulted in substantial civilian harm.\n## Q7: How often have increased military capabilities or technological advancements led to Israeli ground troop invasions in the past?\nAnswer:\nIn the context of the question \"Will Israel invade Lebanon before October 1, 2024?\", historical data on Israeli ground troop invasions in relation to increased military capabilities or technological advancements is limited. However, there are a few notable instances where advancements or strategic military decisions led to ground invasions:\n\n1. **Operation Hiram (1948)**: This operation was conducted during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and aimed at capturing the Upper Galilee region. It was marked by heavy fighting and resulted in significant territorial gains for Israel. The operation was led by General Moshe Carmel and involved coordinated military efforts, suggesting that strategic planning and military capability played a role in its execution \\[[11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Hiram#:~:text=%20Operation%20Hiram%20was%20a%20military%20operation%20conducted%20by%20the%20Israel%20Defense%20Forces%20%28IDF%29%20during%20the%201948%20Arab-Israeli%20War)\\].\n\n2. **Battle of Suez (1973)**: During the Yom Kippur War, Israel decided to capture the city of Suez on October 23, 1973, assuming it would be poorly defended. This decision was influenced by the imminent arrival of UN observers and the strategic importance of the city. An armored brigade and an infantry battalion were committed to the task, although the operation faced significant challenges and heavy resistance \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Suez#:~:text=The%20Battle%20of%20Suez%20was%20fought%20on%20October%2024%E2%80%9325%2C%201973%20between%20the%20Israel%20Defense%20Forces%20and%20the%20Egyptian%20Army%20in%20the%20Egyptian%20town%20of%20Suez)\\]\\[[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Suez#:~:text=It%20was%20the%20last%20major%20battle%20of%20the%20Yom%20Kippur%20War%2C%20before%20a%20ceasefire%20took%20effect)\\]\\[[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Suez#:~:text=%20On%20October%2023%2C%20with%20the%20imminent%20arrival%20of%20UN%20observers%20to%20the%20front%2C%20Israel%20decided%20to%20capture%20Suez%2C%20assuming%20it%20would%20be%20poorly%20defended)\\].\n\nThese examples indicate that while increased military capabilities and strategic decisions have led to ground invasions in the past, the outcomes have varied based on the specific context and execution of the operations. The historical frequency of such invasions is not high, and each instance appears to be driven by a combination of strategic necessity and available military resources.\n\n# S3: FORECASTS\n*Median prediction*: 10.0%\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 0\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- Israel has conducted three major ground invasions into Lebanon over the past 50 years: 1978, 1982, and 2006. This results in a base rate of 3/50 or 6% [Q0]\n- Full-scale invasions following escalations with Hezbollah have occurred twice in the past 50 years: 1982 and 2006. This results in a base rate of 2/50 or 4% [Q1]\n- Israel has a history of responding to significant provocations with military action, with a notable success rate of threats leading to invasions. This suggests a base rate of around 10% [Q3]\n- The historical frequency of Israeli ground troop invasions in response to significant civilian displacement and casualties is approximately 6% [Q6]\n- 39% of Metaculus questions resolved positively in 2018 [General Knowledge]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.1\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 10% because it aggregates information about Israel's historical responses to significant provocations and threats, which is highly relevant to the current situation.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Recent statements by Israeli officials indicate a high level of readiness and willingness to engage militarily if provoked [Q1]\n- Hezbollah's aggressive stance and threats of major retaliation increase the likelihood of escalation [Q2]\n- The current situation on the ground in southern Lebanon is marked by significant hostilities and civilian impact, which historically has led to Israeli invasions [Q3]\n- The U.S. is preparing for a potential conflict involving Hezbollah, indicating a strategic alignment with Israel [Q5]\n- Israel has recently integrated new technologies and advanced systems into its military operations, enhancing its readiness for conflict [Q6]\n\n*Cons*: \n- International diplomatic efforts are ongoing to de-escalate the conflict, though their success remains uncertain [Q7]\n- Historical frequency of full-scale invasions following escalations with Hezbollah is relatively low [Q1]\n- Recent escalations have not yet resulted in a ground invasion, indicating a possible shift in Israel's immediate military strategy [Q5]\n- The U.S. and France are actively working to prevent the conflict from escalating into an all-out war [Q5]\n\n*Reasoning*: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 10%. Given the high level of readiness and willingness to engage militarily if provoked, I'll adjust up by 5% to 15%. Hezbollah's aggressive stance and threats of major retaliation increase the likelihood of escalation, so I'll adjust up by another 5% to 20%. The significant hostilities and civilian impact in southern Lebanon historically leading to invasions warrant an additional 5% increase to 25%. The U.S. preparing for a potential conflict involving Hezbollah suggests strategic alignment with Israel, so I'll adjust up by 2% to 27%. Israel's recent integration of new technologies and advanced systems into its military operations enhances its readiness, so I'll adjust up by 3% to 30%. However, ongoing international diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the conflict and the relatively low historical frequency of full-scale invasions following escalations with Hezbollah suggest a cautious approach, so I'll adjust down by 5% to 25%. The recent escalations not yet resulting in a ground invasion and the active efforts by the U.S. and France to prevent an all-out war warrant a further 5% decrease to 20%.\n\n*Prediction*: 20.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 1\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- Israel has conducted several ground troop invasions into Lebanon over the past 50 years. Notable instances include the 1978 invasion, the 1982 invasion, and the 2006 Lebanon War. This gives a base rate of 3 significant invasions in 50 years, or 6% per year. Since we are looking at a 2.5-month period, the base rate is approximately 1.25% [Q0]\n- Historical data indicates that significant provocations by Hezbollah have led to major conflicts with Israel, such as the 1982 and 2006 invasions. This suggests a base rate of 2 major conflicts in 50 years, or 4% per year. For a 2.5-month period, this translates to approximately 0.83% [Q4]\n- The historical success rate of Israeli military threats leading to actual invasions is notable, particularly with preemptive strikes. This suggests a higher base rate, but no specific percentage is provided [Q3]\n- The base rate of Metaculus questions resolving positively in 2018 is 39% [General Knowledge]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.0125\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 1.25% based on the historical frequency of Israeli ground troop invasions into Lebanon. This base rate is directly relevant to the question and considers the specific context of ground invasions.\n\n*Pros*:\n- The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah has significantly escalated, with Hezbollah's leader declaring a new phase of conflict and threatening major retaliation [Q0]\n- Recent statements by Israeli officials indicate a high level of readiness and willingness to engage militarily with Hezbollah if provoked [Q1]\n- Hezbollah has made aggressive statements and shown a high level of readiness for large-scale conflict [Q2]\n- The situation on the ground in southern Lebanon is marked by escalating hostilities and significant civilian impact, which historically has led to Israeli invasions [Q3]\n- The United States is preparing for a potential conflict involving Hezbollah, indicating a strategic alignment with Israel [Q5]\n\n*Cons*: \n- International diplomatic efforts are ongoing to de-escalate the conflict, although their success remains uncertain [Q7]\n- Recent escalations have not yet resulted in a large-scale ground invasion, indicating a possible shift in Israel's immediate military strategy [Q5]\n- The historical frequency of Israeli ground troop invasions is relatively low, with only a few significant instances over the past 50 years [Q0]\n- The base rate of Israeli ground troop invasions following significant civilian displacement and casualties is not high [Q6]\n\n*Reasoning*: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 1.25%. Given the significant escalation in the conflict and aggressive statements from both sides, I'll adjust up by 1% to 2.25%. The high level of readiness and willingness to engage militarily from Israeli officials and Hezbollah's aggressive stance further support an upward adjustment by 1% to 3.25%. The ongoing hostilities and significant civilian impact in southern Lebanon, which historically has led to invasions, justify an additional 1% increase to 4.25%. However, the ongoing diplomatic efforts and the relatively low historical frequency of invasions suggest caution, so I'll adjust down by 0.5% to 3.75%.

This gives a base rate of 3/50 = 0.06 or 6% [Q0]\n- In the past 50 years, Israel has conducted 2 major ground invasions into Lebanon following significant provocations by Hezbollah (1982, 2006). This gives a base rate of 2/50 = 0.04 or 4% [Q1]\n- Israel has conducted 2 major ground invasions into Lebanon following significant civilian displacement and casualties (1982, 2006). This gives a base rate of 2/50 = 0.04 or 4% [Q6]\n- Israel has conducted 2 major ground invasions into Lebanon following the establishment of a new phase of conflict declared by Hezbollah (1982, 2006).

Recent statements by Israeli officials and Hezbollah's leader, as well as the current situation on the ground, suggest a high level of readiness for conflict, so I'll adjust up by 4% to 10%. The United States preparing for a potential conflict involving Hezbollah also supports an increase, so I'll adjust up by another 2% to 12%. However, international diplomatic efforts and the aim to prevent escalation into an all-out war suggest a decrease, so I'll adjust down by 3% to 9%.

Key areas of focus include economic policies, healthcare, and climate change.\n\n1. **Economic Policies**: Harris has proposed significant economic initiatives such as $25,000 in down-payment aid for first-time home buyers and continued support for the child tax credit. She also aims to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, aligning with President Biden's position. Additionally, she has called for legislation to punish companies engaged in price-gouging \\[[5](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/20/harris-cautious-hold-details-campaign#:~:text=The%20Democratic%20Party%27s%20policy%20platform%20originally%20was%20passed%20through%20a%20committee%20on%20July%2016%20%E2%80%94%20before%20Biden%20dropped%20out%20%E2%80%94%20and%20still%20includes%20several%20references%20to%20a%20second%20Biden%20term%20rather%20than%20a%20Harris%20presidency)\\]\\[[11](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/20/harris-cautious-hold-details-campaign#:~:text=They%20largely%20focused%20on%20the%20economy%2C%20as%20Donald%20Trump%20maintains%20a%20polling%20lead%20on%20the%20issue)\\].\n\n2. **Healthcare**: Harris has moderated her stance on healthcare. While she previously supported Bernie Sanders' \"Medicare for All\" bill, which would have eliminated private health insurance, she has since walked back on this position. Her current healthcare plan envisions a gradual transition to government-backed health insurance over ten years without completely eliminating private insurance \\[[4](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-policy-positions-president-2024/#:~:text=Joe%20Biden%27s%20campaign%20manager%20at%20the%20time%2C%20Kate%20Bedingfield%2C%20said%20of%20Harris%20that%20she%20had%20a%20%22long%20and%20confusing%20pattern%20of%20equivocating%20about%20%28her%29%20stance%20on%20health%20care%20in%20America)\\]\\[[6](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-policy-positions-president-2024/#:~:text=%22%20During%20a%20primary%20debate%20in%202019%2C%20Harris%20raised%20her%20hand%20when%20moderators%20asked%20candidates%20if%20they%20would%20get%20rid%20of%20private%20health%20insurance)\\].\n\n3. **Climate Change**: Harris has emphasized her commitment to addressing the climate crisis. She played a pivotal role in the Biden administration's significant investment in climate initiatives and aims to ensure clean air, clean water, and affordable, reliable energy for all Americans.

This historical context suggests a challenging path for female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections.\n## Q2: How often have incumbent Presidents or Vice Presidents won re-election compared to their challengers?\nAnswer:\nIn the context of the larger question \"Will Kamala Harris win the US 2024 election?\", it is important to consider historical data on the re-election rates of incumbent Presidents and Vice Presidents. Historically, first-term incumbents have a significant advantage unless there is a recession during or just before the election. Since World War II, incumbents have always won re-election when there was no recession \\[[1](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/us-president-incumbents-tend-to-win-elections-except-during-recessions.html#:~:text=When%20there%20is%20no%20recession%2C%20the%20incumbent%20has%20always%20won%20in%20the%20post-World%20War%20II%20era)\\]\\[[3](https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/us-president-incumbents-tend-to-win-elections-except-during-recessions.html#:~:text=First-term%20incumbency%20typically%20provides%20an%20advantage%20%E2%80%94%20unless%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20recession%20during%20or%20just%20before%20the%20election)\\].

Only five Vice Presidents have successfully won the Presidency through an election: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren, Richard Nixon, and George H.W. Bush \\[[3](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/10/21/9574065/vice-presidents-president-history#:~:text=There%20have%20been%2017%20bids%20for%20the%20presidency%20launched%20after%20a%20vice%20presidents%27%20term)\\]\\[[12](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2015/10/21/9574065/vice-presidents-president-history#:~:text=Five%20vice%20presidents%20tried%20and%20failed%20to%20get%20their%20party%27s%20endorsement)\\]. This indicates that while it is possible, it is not a common occurrence.\n\n2. **Party Endorsement and Primary Strategy**: Securing the party's endorsement is crucial. For instance, Hubert Humphrey, despite being loyal to the Johnson administration, faced significant opposition within his party due to his stance on the Vietnam War. He avoided the primaries and focused on winning delegates at the Democratic National Convention, which ultimately secured his nomination \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey#:~:text=After%20Lyndon%20B)\\]\\[[13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey#:~:text=%20In%20March%201968%2C%20Johnson%20made%20his%20surprise%20announcement%20that%20he%20would%20not%20seek%20reelection%2C%20and%20Humphrey%20launched%20his%20campaign%20for%20the%20presidency)\\]. This highlights the importance of internal party dynamics and strategic delegate acquisition.\n\n3. **Political Continuity and Support**: Vice Presidents who have won the Presidency often benefited from the support of their predecessors or the continuation of popular policies. Martin Van Buren, for example, was hand-picked by outgoing President Andrew Jackson and was a master politician who navigated a tough election successfully \\[[4](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/the-day-the-senate-picked-a-u-s-vice-president-on-its-own#:~:text=In%20the%201836%20presidential%20election%2C%20Martin%20Van%20Buren%20won%20the%20election%20with%20170%20electoral%20votes%2C%20defeating%20William%20Henry%20Harrison%20and%20three%20other%20candidates)\\]. This suggests that strong backing from the current administration and a clear political strategy can be advantageous.\n\n4. **Electoral Challenges**: Even with party endorsement, winning the general election can be challenging. Humphrey, despite nearly matching Nixon's popular vote tally, lost the electoral vote by a wide margin \\[[13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey#:~:text=%20In%20March%201968%2C%20Johnson%20made%20his%20surprise%20announcement%20that%20he%20would%20not%20seek%20reelection%2C%20and%20Humphrey%20launched%20his%20campaign%20for%20the%20presidency)\\]. This underscores the importance of not just securing the party nomination but also having a robust general election campaign strategy.\n\nIn summary, while Vice Presidents have historically faced significant challenges in winning the Presidency through election, key factors such as securing party endorsement, strategic delegate acquisition, political continuity, and strong general election campaigns have played pivotal roles in their successes.\n## Q4: What role do fundraising amounts play in predicting the success of a Presidential candidate?\nAnswer:\nFundraising amounts play a significant role in predicting the success of a presidential candidate. Historical data indicates that total fundraising is a strong predictor of success in presidential primaries. For instance, each ten-percentage-point increase in a candidate\u2019s share of total party fundraising during a primary election increases the candidate\u2019s likelihood of winning the nomination by 20% \\[[12](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=At%20the%20start%20of%20the%20primary%20season%2C%20before%20ballots%20have%20been%20cast%2C%20winning%20candidates%20typically%20draw%2085%25%20of%20their%20money%20from%20large%20donors%2C%20compared%20with%2065%25%20for%20candidates%20who%20are%20ultimately%20unsuccessful)\\]. This relationship underscores the importance of financial resources in mounting a competitive campaign.\n\nMoreover, the source of the funds also matters. Winning candidates typically draw a higher percentage of their money from large donors compared to unsuccessful candidates. At the start of the primary season, winning candidates usually receive about 85% of their money from large donors, whereas unsuccessful candidates receive around 65% \\[[12](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=At%20the%20start%20of%20the%20primary%20season%2C%20before%20ballots%20have%20been%20cast%2C%20winning%20candidates%20typically%20draw%2085%25%20of%20their%20money%20from%20large%20donors%2C%20compared%20with%2065%25%20for%20candidates%20who%20are%20ultimately%20unsuccessful)\\]. This suggests that not only the amount but also the composition of fundraising can influence electoral outcomes.\n\nIn summary, both the total amount of funds raised and the mix of donor contributions are critical factors in predicting the success of a presidential candidate. This information can be pivotal in adjusting forecasts for Kamala Harris's chances in the 2024 election.\n## Q5: How accurate have polls been in predicting the outcomes of past US Presidential elections?\nAnswer:\nHistorically, pre-election polls have been relatively good indicators of U.S. presidential election outcomes, with an average error of around 2.5 percentage points dating back to 1980 \\[[3](https://www.thecrosstab.com/2017/01/03/history-polling-error-us-uk/#:~:text=Hillary%20Clinton%20bested%20Donald%20Trump%20in%20the%202016%20election%20popular%20vote%20by%20a%20margin%20of%202)\\]\\[[6](https://www.thecrosstab.com/2017/01/03/history-polling-error-us-uk/#:~:text=Historically%2C%20pre-election%20polls%20are%20relatively%20good%20indicators%20of%20election%20outcomes)\\]. However, there have been notable exceptions where polls have missed the mark, particularly in close elections. For instance, Gallup polling missed the outcomes of the 1948, 1976, and 2004 elections, as well as the popular vote in 2000 and the likely-voter numbers in 2012 \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_polling_for_United_States_presidential_elections#:~:text=Gallup%20polling%20has%20often%20been%20accurate%20in%20predicting%20the%20outcome%20of%20presidential%20elections%20and%20the%20margin%20of%20victory%20for%20the%20winner)\\]. \n\nIn the 2016 election, public opinion polls overestimated Hillary Clinton\u2019s win margin by just one percentage point, making it the fourth most accurate in the last 10 U.S. presidential elections \\[[3](https://www.thecrosstab.com/2017/01/03/history-polling-error-us-uk/#:~:text=Hillary%20Clinton%20bested%20Donald%20Trump%20in%20the%202016%20election%20popular%20vote%20by%20a%20margin%20of%202)\\]\\[[6](https://www.thecrosstab.com/2017/01/03/history-polling-error-us-uk/#:~:text=Historically%2C%20pre-election%20polls%20are%20relatively%20good%20indicators%20of%20election%20outcomes)\\]. Despite this, the 2016 polls were criticized for underestimating Trump voters, especially at the state level \\[[13](https://oaj.fupress.net/index.php/qoe/article/view/9529#:~:text=In%20recent%20US%20presidential%20elections%2C%20there%20has%20been%20considerable%20focus%20on%20how%20well%20public%20opinion%20can%20forecast%20the%20outcome%2C%20and%202016%20proved%20no%20exception)\\]. This suggests that while national polls can provide a general sense of the election outcome, they may not always capture the nuances of voter behavior, particularly in closely contested races.\n## Q6: What is the historical impact of strong media engagement on the success of Presidential candidates?\nAnswer:\nThe historical impact of strong media engagement on the success of Presidential candidates is significant but varies depending on the election phase and the media landscape. Research indicates that media coverage can shape public perception and candidate support, particularly during the primaries and caucuses. For instance, data from the 2012 Presidential election demonstrated the substantial influence of media coverage, especially from outlets like Fox News, on candidate support \\[[1](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/02/10/how-media-coverage-shapes-presidential-polling-more-than-we-think/#:~:text=Data%20from%20the%202012%20Presidential%20election%20shows%20the%20enormous%20impact%20that%20media%20coverage%2C%20especially%20on%20Fox%2C%20can%20have%20on%20candidate%20support%20and%20how%20it%E2%80%99s%20likely%20shaping%20the%202016%20race)\\]\\[[10](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/02/10/how-media-coverage-shapes-presidential-polling-more-than-we-think/#:~:text=Pundits%20tell%20us%20all%20the%20time%20that%20media%20coverage%20is%20driving%20the%20current%20Presidential%20primary%2C%20that%20Donald%20Trump%20and%20other%20outsider%20candidates%20are%20only%20doing%20well%20because%20they%20attract%20so%20much%20attention%20from%20the%20press)\\]. This influence is likely due to the media's role in framing candidates and issues, providing voters with more information, and shaping the narrative around campaigns \\[[1](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2016/02/10/how-media-coverage-shapes-presidential-polling-more-than-we-think/#:~:text=Data%20from%20the%202012%20Presidential%20election%20shows%20the%20enormous%20impact%20that%20media%20coverage%2C%20especially%20on%20Fox%2C%20can%20have%20on%20candidate%20support%20and%20how%20it%E2%80%99s%20likely%20shaping%20the%202016%20race)\\].\n\nHowever, the impact of media engagement during the general election is less pronounced. By the time of the general election, most voters have already formed strong opinions about the candidates, and party identification becomes a dominant factor in voting decisions. For example, in the 2012 election, nearly 70% of voters had decided whom to vote for before September, indicating that media influence is more limited at this stage \\[[12](https://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12184766/media-boost-donald-trump-coverage#:~:text=However%2C%20as%20Vanderbilt%20political%20scientist%20Larry%20Bartels%E2%80%99s%20research%20suggests%2C%20a%20general%20election%20campaign%20for%20the%20presidency%20is%20probably%20not%20the%20best%20place%20to%20find%20evidence%20of%20media%20influence)\\]. Additionally, the dynamic nature of the media environment, with the rise of cable television and the Internet, has changed how voters consume information, making it more challenging to measure the direct impact of media on election outcomes \\[[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08824090409359978#:~:text=However%2C%20we%20argue%20that%20the%20media%20environment%20is%20dynamic%20%28e)\\]\\[[7](https://journalism.uoregon.edu/news/six-ways-media-influences-elections#:~:text=Recent%20shifts%20in%20the%20media%20landscape%20have%20changed%20how%20the%20press%20interacts%20with%20candidates%2C%20campaigns%20and%20the%20voting%20public)\\].\n\nIn summary, while strong media engagement can significantly influence candidate success during the primaries, its impact diminishes during the general election as voters' preferences become more entrenched.\n\nSources:\n1.

Additionally, a higher share of women (68.4%) than men (65.0%) turned out to vote, which is consistent with past elections \\[[1](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2020-presidential-election-voting-and-registration-tables-now-available.html#:~:text=These%20data%20come%20from%20the%202020%20Current%20Population%20Survey%20Voting%20and%20Registration%20Supplement%20for%20the%20November%202020%20presidential%20election%2C%20which%20surveyed%20the%20civilian%20noninstitutionalized%20population%20in%20the%20United%20States)\\]. Voter turnout also increased with age, educational attainment, and income \\[[5](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2020-presidential-election-voting-and-registration-tables-now-available.html#:~:text=The%20table%20package%20shows%20patterns%20of%20voter%20turnout%20by%20race%2C%20Hispanic%20origin%2C%20age%20and%20other%20characteristics%20such%20as%20educational%20attainment%20and%20family%20income)\\]. Specifically, turnout in the 35-64 age group was 69% in 2020, up from 65% in 2016, and for those 65 and older, it was 74% in 2020, compared to 71% in 2016 \\[[6](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/04/record-high-turnout-in-2020-general-election.html#:~:text=In%20the%2035-64%20age%20group%2C%20turnout%20was%2069%25%2C%20compared%20to%2065%25%20in%202016)\\].\n\nThese trends suggest that demographic groups that are likely to support Kamala Harris, such as women, Asians, and older voters, have shown increased voter turnout in recent elections. This information could be crucial for forecasting her chances in the 2024 election.\n\n# S3: FORECASTS\n*Median prediction*: 32.0%\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 0\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- Since 1948, 33% of sitting Vice Presidents who ran for President have won the election [Q0]\n- Historically, 39% of Metaculus questions resolved positively in 2018 [General]\n- In U.S. history, only one female candidate from a major party has won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College [Q1]\n- Out of 43 presidents, only 16 won two consecutive elections, indicating a success rate of approximately 37% for incumbents [Q2]\n- Five Vice Presidents have successfully won the Presidency through an election out of 12 attempts, which is approximately 42% [Q3]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.33\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: The most appropriate base rate is 33% because it specifically relates to sitting Vice Presidents running for President, which is directly relevant to Kamala Harris's situation.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Kamala Harris has strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters [Q0]\n- Harris has seen unprecedented fundraising success, raising over $200 million in the first week [Q1]\n- Key Democratic figures, including President Joe Biden, have endorsed her candidacy [Q4]\n- Recent polls show Harris has gained ground and is performing better than before Biden's withdrawal [Q5]\n- Voter turnout among demographic groups that support Harris has increased in recent elections [Q7]\n\n*Cons*: \n- A plurality of Americans believe Donald Trump is more likely to win the Presidential Election [Q0]\n- Harris has faced criticism for limited media engagement and lack of detailed policy plans [Q1]\n- Trump leads Harris by 5 points in a head-to-head matchup according to Rasmussen Reports [Q0]\n- The historical success rate of female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections is low [Q1]\n- Harris has avoided press conferences and interviews, raising questions about her transparency [Q6]\n\n*Reasoning*: Starting with the base rate of 33% for sitting Vice Presidents who ran for President. Adjusting upwards for strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters (+5%), unprecedented fundraising success (+5%), key endorsements (+5%), and recent polling gains (+5%). Adjusting downwards for public perception favoring Trump (-5%), limited media engagement and lack of detailed policy plans (-5%), Rasmussen poll showing Trump leading (-5%), historical challenges for female candidates (-5%), and criticism for avoiding press conferences (-5%).\n\n*Prediction*: 33.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 1\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- In U.S. history, twelve sitting Vice Presidents have run for President while in office. Out of these twelve, four have been elected to the presidency, which translates to a success rate of approximately 33% [Q0.Q0]\n- The historical success rate of female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections is notably low, with no female candidate having won the presidency [Q0.Q1]\n- Out of the 43 men who served as president before the current incumbent, only 16 won two consecutive elections, indicating a success rate of less than half [Q0.Q2]\n- Only five Vice Presidents have successfully won the Presidency through an election: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren, Richard Nixon, and George H.W. Bush [Q0.Q3]\n- 39% of Metaculus questions resolved positively in 2018 [Q0.Q0]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.33\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 33% because it specifically pertains to sitting Vice Presidents running for President, which is directly relevant to Kamala Harris's situation.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Kamala Harris has strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters [Q0.Q0]\n- Harris's campaign has seen unprecedented fundraising success, raising over $200 million in the first week [Q1.Q1]\n- Harris has received significant endorsements from high-profile Democrats, including President Joe Biden [Q4.Q4]\n- Recent analyses from FiveThirtyEight indicate that Harris's chances have improved significantly following Biden's withdrawal from the race [Q5.Q5]\n\n*Cons*: \n- A plurality of Americans believe that Donald Trump is more likely to win the Presidential Election compared to Kamala Harris [Q0.Q0]\n- Harris has faced criticism for her limited media engagement and lack of detailed policy plans [Q1.Q1]\n- In a head-to-head matchup, Trump leads Harris by 5 points according to Rasmussen Reports [Q0.Q0]\n- Historical success rate of female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections is notably low [Q0.Q1]\n- Prediction markets show skepticism about Harris's chances, with significant sentiment that other candidates might overshadow her [Q3.Q3]\n\n*Reasoning*: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 33%. Given the strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters, I'll adjust up by 5% to 38%. The unprecedented fundraising success and significant endorsements from high-profile Democrats, including President Joe Biden, warrant another upward adjustment of 7%, bringing it to 45%. However, the plurality of Americans believing Trump is more likely to win and the head-to-head matchup showing Trump leading Harris by 5 points necessitate a downward adjustment of 10%, bringing it to 35%. The historical success rate of female candidates and the skepticism in prediction markets further justify a downward adjustment of 5%, bringing the final prediction to 30%.\n\n*Prediction*: 30.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 2\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- In U.S. history, twelve sitting Vice Presidents have run for President while in office. Out of these twelve, four have been elected to the presidency, which translates to a success rate of approximately 33% [S2.Q0]\n- Historically, the success rate for Vice Presidents ascending to the Presidency through election is relatively low. Only five Vice Presidents have successfully won the Presidency through an election: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren, Richard Nixon, and George H.W. Bush [S2.Q3]\n- 39% of Metaculus questions resolved positively in 2018 [S2.Q0]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.33\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 33% because it directly pertains to the historical success rate of sitting Vice Presidents running for President, which is highly relevant to Kamala Harris's situation.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Kamala Harris has strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters [S1.Q0]\n- Harris's campaign has seen unprecedented fundraising success, raising over $200 million in the first week [S1.Q1]\n- Harris has received significant endorsements from key Democratic figures, including President Joe Biden and California Governor Gavin Newsom [S1.Q4]\n- Recent analyses from FiveThirtyEight indicate that Harris's chances have improved significantly following Biden's withdrawal from the race [S1.Q5]\n- Voter turnout among demographic groups that support Kamala Harris, such as women and Asians, has increased in recent elections [S2.Q7]\n\n*Cons*: \n- A plurality of Americans (42%) believe that Donald Trump is more likely to win the Presidential Election compared to 39% who think Kamala Harris would be more likely to win [S1.Q0]\n- In a head-to-head matchup, Trump leads Harris by 5 points (49% to 44%) according to Rasmussen Reports [S1.Q0]\n- Harris has faced criticism for her limited media engagement since launching her campaign [S1.Q1]\n- Harris's campaign has been criticized for a lack of concrete policy plans on her campaign website [S1.Q1]\n- The historical success rate of female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections is notably low [S2.Q1]\n\n*Reasoning*: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 33%. Kamala Harris has strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters, which is a positive sign, so I'll adjust up by 3% to 36%. Her unprecedented fundraising success and significant endorsements from key Democratic figures are also strong positives, so I'll adjust up by another 4% to 40%. Recent analyses from FiveThirtyEight indicating improved chances following Biden's withdrawal add another 2%, bringing it to 42%. However, the plurality of Americans believing Trump is more likely to win and the head-to-head matchup showing Trump leading by 5 points are significant negatives, so I'll adjust down by 5% to 37%. Her limited media engagement and lack of concrete policy plans are also concerning, so I'll adjust down by another 3% to 34%. Finally, considering the historical low success rate of female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections, I'll adjust down by 2% to 32%.\n\n*Prediction*: 32.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 3\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- Since World War II, incumbents have always won re-election when there was no recession, suggesting a high base rate for incumbents [S2.Q2]\n- Out of 43 presidents, only 16 won two consecutive elections, indicating a base rate of approximately 37% for re-election [S2.Q2]\n- Twelve sitting Vice Presidents have run for President while in office, with four winning, giving a base rate of approximately 33% [S2.Q0]\n- Historically, female candidates have a low success rate in U.S. Presidential elections, with no woman winning the presidency yet [S2.Q1]\n- 39% of Metaculus questions resolved positively in 2018 [S2.Q2]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.33\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: The most appropriate base rate is 33% for sitting Vice Presidents running for President. This base rate is specific to the scenario of a sitting Vice President running for President, which closely matches Kamala Harris's situation. It is more relevant than general incumbency or female candidate success rates.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Kamala Harris has strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters [S2.Q0]\n- Harris's campaign has seen unprecedented fundraising success, raising over $200 million in the first week [S2.Q1]\n- Harris has received significant endorsements from key Democratic figures, including President Joe Biden [S2.Q4]\n- Recent polls show Harris performing better nationally after Biden's withdrawal [S2.Q5]\n\n*Cons*: \n- A plurality of Americans believe Donald Trump is more likely to win the Presidential Election [S2.Q0]\n- Harris has faced criticism for limited media engagement and lack of detailed policy plans [S2.Q1]\n- In a head-to-head matchup, Trump leads Harris by 5 points according to Rasmussen Reports [S2.Q0]\n- Historical success rate of female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections is low [S2.Q1]\n- Prediction markets show skepticism about Harris's chances, with significant sentiment that other candidates might overshadow her [S2.Q3]\n\n*Reasoning*: Starting with the chosen base rate of 33% for sitting Vice Presidents running for President. Harris has strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters, which is a positive factor, so I'll adjust up by 5% to 38%. Her unprecedented fundraising success is another positive factor, so I'll adjust up by another 5% to 43%. Significant endorsements from key Democratic figures also support her chances, so I'll adjust up by 2% to 45%. Recent polls showing Harris performing better nationally after Biden's withdrawal is a positive sign, so I'll adjust up by 2% to 47%. However, a plurality of Americans believe Trump is more likely to win, which is a negative factor, so I'll adjust down by 3% to 44%. Criticism for limited media engagement and lack of detailed policy plans is another negative factor, so I'll adjust down by 2% to 42%. The head-to-head matchup where Trump leads Harris by 5 points is a significant negative factor, so I'll adjust down by 5% to 37%. The low historical success rate of female candidates in U.S. Presidential elections is another negative factor, so I'll adjust down by 2% to 35%. Finally, prediction markets show skepticism about Harris's chances, which is a significant negative factor, so I'll adjust down by 5% to 30%.\n\n*Prediction*: 30.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 4\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- Since World War II, incumbents have always won re-election when there was no recession, indicating a high success rate for incumbents in favorable economic conditions [S2.Q2]\n- Out of 43 presidents, only 16 won two consecutive elections, indicating a success rate of approximately 37% for re-election [S2.Q2]\n- Twelve sitting Vice Presidents have run for President while in office, with a success rate of approximately 33% [S2.Q0]\n- Historically, five Vice Presidents have successfully won the Presidency through an election, indicating a success rate of 29% [S3.Q3]\n- Female candidates have a very low historical success rate in U.S. Presidential elections, with no woman having won the presidency yet [S2.Q1]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.33\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: The most appropriate base rate is 33% for sitting Vice Presidents running for President. This base rate is specific to the scenario of a sitting Vice President running for President and accounts for historical precedents.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Kamala Harris has strong support among Biden's previous voters and some non-voters [S1.Q0]\n- Harris has seen unprecedented fundraising success, raising over $200 million in the first week of her campaign [S1.Q1]\n- Harris has received significant endorsements from key Democratic figures, including President Joe Biden [S3.Q4]\n- Recent analyses from FiveThirtyEight indicate that Harris's chances have improved significantly following Biden's withdrawal from the race [S3.Q5]\n- Voter turnout among demographic groups that support Harris, such as women and Asians, has increased in recent elections [S3.Q7]\n\n*Cons*: \n- A plurality of Americans believe Donald Trump is more likely to win the Presidential Election [S1.Q0]\n- Harris has faced criticism for limited media engagement and lack of concrete policy plans [S1.Q1]\n- Trump leads Harris by 5 points in a head-to-head matchup according to Rasmussen Reports [S1.Q0]\n- Female candidates have historically had a very low success rate in U.S. Presidential elections [S2.Q1]\n- Harris's campaign has been criticized for avoiding press conferences and interviews, raising questions about her transparency [S3.Q6]\n\n*Reasoning*: Starting with the base rate of 33% for sitting Vice Presidents running for President. Harris's strong support among Biden's previous voters and her unprecedented fundraising success are positive factors, so I'll adjust up by 5% to 38%. Significant endorsements from key Democratic figures and improved chances following Biden's withdrawal are also positive, so I'll adjust up by another 5% to 43%. Increased voter turnout among demographic groups that support Harris is a positive sign, so I'll adjust up by 2% to 45%. However, the plurality of Americans believing Trump is more likely to win and Trump's lead in head-to-head matchups are significant negatives, so I'll adjust down by 7% to 38%. Criticisms of limited media engagement and lack of concrete policy plans, as well as the historical low success rate of female candidates, are additional negatives, so I'll adjust down by another 5% to 33%. Finally, criticism for avoiding press conferences and interviews is a minor negative, so I'll adjust down by 1% to 32%.\n\n*Prediction*: 32.0%\n\n\n\n",

Adjusted up for strong polling in battleground states and high retention of 2020 voters, and significant fundraising. Adjusted down for multiple legal challenges, lower campaign visibility, and mixed polling accuracy.\n- *Forecaster 1*: [Predicted 67.0%] Chose a base rate of 74% based on the re-election success rate of U.S. presidents. Adjusted up for leading in key battleground states and strong support from 2020 voters. Adjusted down for multiple legal challenges, impeachment, and financial scandals.\n- *Forecaster 2*: [Predicted 65.0%] Chose a base rate of 74% reflecting the historical success rate of presidents seeking re-election. Adjusted up for leading in battleground states and strong fundraising. Adjusted down for legal challenges, lower campaign visibility, and Harris leading among new voters.\n- *Forecaster 3*: [Predicted 67.0%] Chose a base rate of 74% based on incumbents' re-election success. Adjusted up for strong fundraising and support from 2020 voters. Adjusted down for legal challenges, mixed social media impact, and close polling averages in battleground states.\n- *Forecaster 4*: [Predicted 66.0%] Chose a base rate of 74% based on re-election success rate of U.S. presidents. Adjusted up for strong fundraising and support in battleground states. Adjusted down for legal challenges, less visible campaign activity, and trailing in prediction markets.\n\n## Summary of the Research\nThe research focused on various factors influencing Donald Trump's chances of winning the 2024 US Presidential Election. Key points include Trump's strong polling in battleground states, retaining 90% of his 2020 voters, and significant fundraising efforts. However, he faces multiple legal challenges, including a ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court that he engaged in insurrection, making him ineligible to hold the office of President, pending review by the United States Supreme Court. Additionally, his campaign activity appears less visible compared to previous cycles, and skipping debates may have hurt his standing in the polls [S1.Q0, S1.Q1, S1.Q7].\n\nThe research also examined historical data and base rates, such as the 74% re-election success rate of U.S. presidents who sought re-election in the past 100 years. Polling data has had a mixed record in predicting election outcomes, with an actual accuracy closer to 60%. The leader in national polls three months before the election has won only half the time in the past ten presidential campaigns. Additionally, there are no historical precedents of a major party candidate with significant legal troubles winning the US Presidential Election [S2.Q0, S2.Q2, S2.Q5, S2.Q3].\n\n## Possible Base Rates\n- In the past 100 years, 14 out of 19 U.S. presidents who sought re-election were successful, giving a re-election success rate of approximately 74% [S2.Q0]\n- Less than half of all U.S. presidents who have served have been re-elected to a second term in office, with 21 presidents winning a second term [S2.Q0]\n- The leader in national polls three months before the election has won the election only half the time in the past ten presidential campaigns [S2.Q5]\n- Polling data has had a mixed record in predicting the winner of the US Presidential Election over the last 50 years, with an accuracy closer to 60% [S2.Q2]\n- 39% of Metaculus questions resolved positively in 2018 [S2.Q0]\n\n## Pros\n- Donald Trump is leading in 5 of the 7 battleground states that are most likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential Election [S1.Q0]\n- Trump retains the support of 90% of those who voted for him in 2020 [S1.Q0]\n- Trump's campaign has managed to raise significant funds, reportedly pulling in \\$7.1 million since his mug shot was taken in Atlanta, and nearly \\$20 million over three weeks following his indictments and arraignment [S1.Q1]\n- LaRouchePAC has officially endorsed Donald Trump for the 2024 Presidential Election [S1.Q6]\n- A significant majority of Republican primary voters believe that Trump is the best candidate to beat Joe Biden in the 2024 election [S1.Q6]\n\n## Cons\n- Trump faces multiple legal challenges, including a ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court that he engaged in insurrection, making him ineligible to hold the office of President, pending review by the United States Supreme Court [S1.Q7]\n- Trump is under investigation by Atlanta-area prosecutor Fani Willis for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia, with potential charges looming [S1.Q7]\n- Trump's campaign activity appears to be less visible compared to previous election cycles [S1.Q1]\n- Skipping debates may have hurt Trump's standing in the polls [S1.Q1]\n- Polling and betting markets indicate that Trump is trailing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by a significant margin [S1.Q3]\n\n## Weaknesses and possible improvements\n- *Inconsistent Polling Data Interpretation*: The research mentions mixed accuracy of polling data but does not reconcile this with the reliance on current polling data for predictions. Quote: \"Polling data has had a mixed record in predicting the winner of the US Presidential Election over the last 50 years\" [S2.Q2]\n- *Overemphasis on Fundraising*: While significant, the research may overemphasize the impact of fundraising without adequately considering other factors like voter sentiment and legal challenges. Quote: \"Having a robust fundraising lead is generally a strong predictor of success in U.S. Presidential Elections\" [S2.Q4]\n- *Lack of Resolution Criteria*: The research does not provide specific resolution criteria for what constitutes a \"win\" in the context of the 2024 election, which could lead to ambiguity in interpreting the results. Quote: \"No resolution criteria provided\" [Question details]\n\n\n# S1: BACKGROUND Q&A\n## Q0: What is the current polling data for Donald Trump in the 2024 US Presidential Election?\nAnswer:\nAs of the latest polling data, Donald Trump is leading in 5 of the 7 battleground states that are most likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential Election \\[[1](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/presidential-polling-averages/?itid=co_election2024_2#:~:text=Note%3A%20Following%20President%20Joe%20Biden%E2%80%99s%20%20%20decision%20to%20withdraw%20from%20the%20presidential%20race%20%20%2C%20Vice%20President%20Kamala%20Harris%20is%20the%20Democratic%20Party%E2%80%99s%20nominee)\\]\\[[5](https://www.washingtonpost.com/elections/interactive/2024/presidential-polling-averages/?itid=co_election2024_2#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%20is%20leading%20in%205%20of%20the%207%20battleground%20states%20that%20are%20most%20likely%20to%20determine%20the%20outcome%20of%20the%20election)\\].

[Redfield & Wilton Strategies](https://redfieldandwiltonstrategies.com/joe-biden-administration-approval-ratings-and-hypothetical-voting-intention-7-august-2024/)\n## Q1: What are recent news articles saying about Donald Trump's campaign performance?\nAnswer:\nRecent news articles provide a mixed picture of Donald Trump's campaign performance for the 2024 US Presidential Election. Here are some key points:\n\n- **Legal Troubles and Fundraising**: Trump's legal issues have intensified, with multiple indictments related to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. Despite these challenges, his campaign has managed to raise significant funds, reportedly pulling in $7.1 million since his mug shot was taken in Atlanta, and nearly $20 million over three weeks following his indictments and arraignment \\[[6](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/26/politics/trump-mugshot-fundraising-campaign/index.html#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20legal%20troubles%20have%20mounted%20in%20recent%20weeks%2C%20with%20prosecutors%20bringing%20two%20indictments%20related%20to%20his%20attempts%20to%20overturn%20the%202020%20election%20results)\\]\\[[14](https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/26/politics/trump-mugshot-fundraising-campaign/index.html#:~:text=Donald%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20campaign%20says%20it%20has%20raised%20%247)\\]. This suggests that his legal troubles may be galvanizing his base and boosting fundraising efforts.\n\n- **Social Media Strategy**: Trump has returned to the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), where he has a much larger audience (90 million followers) compared to his own platform, Truth Social (7.6 million followers). However, his recent posts have not generated as much coverage as they once did, creating uncertainty about their impact on the electorate \\[[3](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4850705-trump-returns-x-social-media-platform/#:~:text=Trump%E2%80%99s%20posts%20over%20the%20last%20few%20days%20haven%E2%80%99t%20generated%20as%20much%20coverage%20as%20they%20once%20did)\\]\\[[4](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4850705-trump-returns-x-social-media-platform/#:~:text=The%20former%20president%20returned%20to%20the%20platform%20formerly%20known%20as%20Twitter%20on%20Aug)\\]\\[[7](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4850705-trump-returns-x-social-media-platform/#:~:text=Former%20President%20Trump%20is%20back%20on%20X%2C%20the%20social%20media%20platform%20formerly%20known%20as%20Twitter%2C%20seeking%20to%20expand%20his%20audience%20at%20a%20time%20when%20he%E2%80%99s%20losing%20ground%20to%20his%20new%20opponent%2C%20Vice%20President%20Harris)\\].\n\n- **Campaign Activity**: Trump's campaign activity appears to be less visible compared to previous election cycles. For instance, he has held fewer public events compared to his rivals and past campaigns. This low visibility strategy is similar to that of President Biden, who has also been running a campaign with minimal risk or visibility \\[[1](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/09/trump-biden-2024-presidential-campaign#:~:text=What%20they%27re%20saying%3A%20%22The%20President%20is%20running%20an%20aggressive%20and%20thoughtful%20official%20and%20campaign%20schedule%20that%20is%20in%20line%20with%20previous%20incumbent%20presidents%20at%20this%20point%20in%20the%20election%20cycle%2C%22%20said%20Kevin%20Munoz%2C%20a%20spokesperson%20for%20the%20Biden%20campaign)\\]\\[[10](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/09/trump-biden-2024-presidential-campaign#:~:text=%22%20%20%20By%20the%20numbers%3A%20Biden%20has%20held%20comparatively%20few%20public%20events%20past%206%20p)\\].\n\n- **Polling and Debates**: There is some indication that skipping debates may have hurt Trump's standing in the polls.

The provided sources primarily discuss the general unreliability of forecasts and the implications of a potential Harris presidency, rather than offering concrete data or predictions from Metaculus.\n\nHowever, for context, it is important to note that forecasts can be highly uncertain and subject to significant changes due to unforeseen events, as highlighted by historical examples such as the impact of 9/11 on George W.

They argue that Trump is the only candidate capable of uniting diverse groups including blue-collar families, scientists, engineers, and veterans \\[[11](https://www.larouchepac.com/larouchepac_endorsement_for_president_trump_s_2024_election_to_the_presidency_of_the_u_s_a#:~:text=President%20Trump%20is%20the%20only%20candidate%20capable%20of%20building%20a%20broad%20coalition%20of%20Americans%2C%20a%20coalition%20of%20producers%20uniting%20blue%20collar%20families%2C%20scientists%20and%20engineers%2C%20people%20of%20religious%20faith%2C%20veterans%2C%20farmers%2C%20immigrants%2C%20and%20many%20others)\\].\n\n2. **Republican Primary Voters' Sentiment**: According to a CBS News poll, a significant majority of Republican primary voters believe that Trump is the best candidate to beat Joe Biden in the 2024 election. Only 9% of likely Republican primary voters consider Trump a \"long shot\" against Biden, while more than 60% think he is a sure bet. This sentiment is crucial as it indicates strong intra-party support for Trump's candidacy \\[[13](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/28/opinion/donald-trump-presidential-campaign.html#:~:text=In%20polling%20by%20CBS%20News%2C%20the%20ability%20to%20beat%20Joe%20Biden%20is%20one%20of%20the%20top%20qualities%20Republican%20primary%20voters%20say%20they%20are%20looking%20for%2C%20and%20they%20think%20Mr)\\].\n\nThese endorsements and polling data suggest a strong base of support for Trump within the Republican Party, which could significantly impact his chances in the 2024 election.\n## Q7: Are there any significant events or scandals involving Donald Trump that could impact his chances of winning?\nAnswer:\nSeveral significant events and scandals involving Donald Trump could impact his chances of winning the US 2024 Election:\n\n1. **Legal Challenges and Indictments**: Trump faces multiple legal challenges, including a ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court that he engaged in insurrection, making him ineligible to hold the office of President. This decision is currently stayed pending review by the United States Supreme Court \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_presidential_eligibility_of_Donald_Trump#:~:text=%20In%20December%202023%2C%20the%20Colorado%20Supreme%20Court%20in%20%20Anderson%20v)\\].

The events of January 6th and the subsequent investigations have continued to cast a shadow over his political career, potentially affecting his electability.\n\n3. **Financial and Fraud Allegations**: New York Attorney General Letitia James has accused Trump of inflating his net worth to secure favorable loan terms and insurance coverage. A New York judge has ordered an independent monitor to oversee the Trump Organization, and James is seeking to bar Trump and his children from running companies in New York and to recover $250 million allegedly obtained through fraud \\[[15](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-legal-problems-does-us-presidential-candidate-trump-face-2022-11-16/#:~:text=James%2C%20a%20Democrat%2C%20accused%20Trump%20of%20inflating%20his%20net%20worth%20by%20billions%20of%20dollars%20to%20obtain%20lower%20interest%20rates%20on%20loans%20and%20get%20better%20insurance%20coverage)\\]. These financial scandals could undermine his credibility and trustworthiness among voters.\n\nThese events collectively present substantial legal and ethical challenges that could influence public opinion and Trump's chances of winning the 2024 election.\n\n# S2: BASE RATE Q&A\n## Q0: What percentage of incumbents or former presidents have won re-election in the past 100 years?\nAnswer:\nIn the past 100 years, 14 out of 19 U.S. presidents who sought re-election were successful, giving a re-election success rate of approximately 74%. This includes presidents who were incumbents or former presidents running for a second term. Notably, Grover Cleveland is the only former president who has ever come back after being defeated for re-election to win a second nonconsecutive term \\[[14](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/11/16/few-former-presidents-have-run-for-their-old-jobs-or-anything-else-after-leaving-office/#:~:text=%20Grover%20Cleveland%20is%20the%20only%20former%20president%20who%20has%20ever%20come%20back%20after%20being%20defeated%20for%20reelection%20to%20win%20a%20second%20nonconsecutive%20term)\\]. \n\nFor a more detailed breakdown, less than half of all U.S. presidents who have served have been re-elected to a second term in office, with 21 presidents winning a second term, including those who assumed office after the death of a sitting president and later won election in their own right \\[[13](https://www.cnn.com/2012/11/09/politics/btn-second-term-presidents#:~:text=%29%20Less%20than%20half%20of%20U)\\]. This historical context can provide a useful benchmark for forecasting the likelihood of Donald Trump winning the 2024 election as a former president seeking re-election.\n## Q1: How often does the leading candidate in battleground state polls win the election?\nAnswer:\nThe accuracy of battleground state polls in predicting the winner of the U.S. presidential election has varied over recent election cycles. An analysis of the 2004, 2008, and 2012 elections found no significant differences in poll accuracy for 2004 and 2008, but significant underestimation of President Obama's performance in 2012 \\[[1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2330443X.2015.1034389#:~:text=The%20presidential%20elections%20of%202004%2C%202008%2C%20and%202012%20are%20examined%2C%20and%20polling%20results%20for%20battleground%20states%20are%20compared%20to%20the%20actual%20margins%20in%20each%20state)\\]\\[[2](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2330443X.2015.1034389#:~:text=No%20significant%20differences%20in%20polls%20were%20found%20in%202004%20or%202008)\\]. This suggests that while battleground state polls can be indicative, they are not always reliable predictors.\n\nMoreover, the 2016 election highlighted the limitations of polling, as many polls failed to predict Donald Trump's victory, partly due to incorrect turnout models and the mobilization of less frequent voters \\[[7](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2018/10/30/are-2018-midterm-election-polls-accurate/#:~:text=In%20many%20states%2C%20there%20weren%E2%80%99t%20any%20polls%20or%20any%20good%20polls)\\]\\[[14](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/brookings-now/2018/10/30/are-2018-midterm-election-polls-accurate/#:~:text=Polls%20most%20frequently%20go%20wrong%20because%20they%20don%E2%80%99t%20predict%20turnout%20correctly)\\]. In 2016, pollsters correctly called 83.8% of the state's electoral votes, yet this was insufficient to predict the overall outcome, with Trump securing 57% of the electoral college \\[[5](https://mark-blessington.medium.com/better-us-election-forecasting-b4f9c841f8e7#:~:text=In%202016%2C%20they%20called%2083)\\].\n\nIn summary, while leading candidates in battleground state polls often have an advantage, historical data shows that these polls are not infallible and can sometimes significantly misestimate outcomes due to various factors such as turnout prediction errors and voter mobilization dynamics.\n## Q2: What is the historical accuracy of polling data in predicting the winner of the US Presidential Election in the last 50 years?\nAnswer:\nPolling data has had a mixed record in predicting the winner of the US Presidential Election over the last 50 years. While Gallup and other major polling organizations have often been accurate, they have missed the mark in several close elections. Notable misses include the 1948, 1976, and 2004 elections, as well as the popular vote in 2000 and the likely-voter numbers in 2012 \\[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_polling_for_United_States_presidential_elections#:~:text=%20Gallup%20was%20the%20first%20polling%20organization%20to%20conduct%20accurate%20opinion%20polling%20for%20United%20States%20presidential%20elections)\\]\\[[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_polling_for_United_States_presidential_elections#:~:text=Gallup%20polling%20has%20often%20been%20accurate%20in%20predicting%20the%20outcome%20of%20presidential%20elections%20and%20the%20margin%20of%20victory%20for%20the%20winner)\\].

This suggests that while polls can provide a general sense of the election landscape, they are not infallible and can be influenced by unforeseen events and methodological issues.\n## Q3: How often has the candidate with significant legal troubles won the US Presidential Election?\nAnswer:\nIn the context of the larger question \"Will Donald Trump win the US 2024 Election?\", historical data on candidates with significant legal troubles winning the US Presidential Election is quite limited. The most notable example is Eugene V. Debs, who ran for president from prison in 1920 on the Socialist Party ticket and garnered almost a million votes, or about 3% of the total, but did not win \\[[9](https://apnews.com/article/trump-prison-run-for-president-e9fb5f5f94c5bd5960bb7d8ee37a336d#:~:text=He%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20even%20be%20the%20first%20candidate%20to%20run%20for%20that%20office%20while%20imprisoned)\\]\\[[10](https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2023/04/01/trump-prison-eugene-debs/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=wp_main#:~:text=Eight%20years%20earlier%2C%20he%E2%80%99d%20won%20901%2C551%20votes%20%E2%80%94%20about%20six%20percent%20of%20the%20vote)\\]. This case is different from Trump's situation as Debs was a fringe candidate, whereas Trump is a former president and a major party nominee.\n\nThere are no historical precedents of a major party candidate with significant legal troubles winning the US Presidential Election. This lack of precedent suggests that while it is not impossible, it is highly unusual and would be an outlier in US political history.\n## Q4: How often has the candidate with a robust fundraising lead won the US Presidential Election?\nAnswer:\nIn the context of the larger question \"Will Donald Trump win the US 2024 Election?\", historical data suggests that having a robust fundraising lead is generally a strong predictor of success in U.S. Presidential Elections. Specifically, total fundraising is a better predictor of success in a presidential primary, regardless of its source. Each ten-percentage-point increase in a candidate\u2019s share of total party fundraising during a primary election increases the candidate\u2019s likelihood of winning the nomination by 20% \\[[1](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=Each%20ten-percentage-point%20increase%20in%20a%20candidate%E2%80%99s%20share%20of%20total%20party%20fundraising%20during%20a%20primary%20election%20increases%20the%20candidate%E2%80%99s%20likelihood%20of%20winning%20the%20nomination%20by%2020%25)\\]\\[[4](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=This%20does%20not%20appear%20to%20be%20driven%20by%20bandwagon%20effects)\\]\\[[8](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=At%20the%20start%20of%20the%20primary%20season%2C%20before%20ballots%20have%20been%20cast%2C%20winning%20candidates%20typically%20draw%2085%25%20of%20their%20money%20from%20large%20donors%2C%20compared%20with%2065%25%20for%20candidates%20who%20are%20ultimately%20unsuccessful)\\].\n\nHowever, there are notable exceptions. For instance, Donald Trump in 2016 raised a smaller share of his money from large donors (25%) than any successful primary candidate since the FEC began collecting data in 1976. Trump also received just 4% of the GOP\u2019s individual donations and would have been the first general election candidate not to lead his party in total campaign contributions since Ronald Reagan in 1980 \\[[1](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=Each%20ten-percentage-point%20increase%20in%20a%20candidate%E2%80%99s%20share%20of%20total%20party%20fundraising%20during%20a%20primary%20election%20increases%20the%20candidate%E2%80%99s%20likelihood%20of%20winning%20the%20nomination%20by%2020%25)\\]\\[[2](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=Raising%20a%20lot%20of%20money%20in%20relatively%20large%20increments%2C%20like%20Bill%20Clinton%20in%201992%20and%20Bush%20in%202000%2C%20is%20still%20a%20better%20strategy%20than%20raising%20more%20modest%20sums%20in%20smaller%20amounts%20like%20Jesse%20Jackson%20in%201988%20or%20Pat%20Buchanan%20in%201996)\\]\\[[11](https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2016/04/26/does-freedom-from-big-money-help-election-campaigns#:~:text=If%20Donald%20Trump%20goes%20on%20to%20win%20the%20Republican%20nomination%2C%20this%20empirical%20relationship%20will%20be%20severely%20weakened)\\].

According to FiveThirtyEight's analysis, the leader in national polls at the end of April has won the election only half the time in the past ten presidential campaigns \\[[11](https://archive.nytimes.com/fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/what-do-springtime-polls-tell-us-about-the-general-election/#:~:text=But%2C%20of%20course%2C%20the%20election%20is%20still%20more%20than%20six%20months%20away%2C%20and%20in%20the%20past%2010%20presidential%20campaigns%2C%20the%20national%20polling%20leader%20in%20late%20April%20has%20won%20the%20election%20only%20half%20Drawn%20from%20FiveThirtyEight%E2%80%99s%20polling%20database%2C%20which%20includes%20thousands%20of%20surveys%2C%20here%20is%20the%20average%20of%20the%2010%20most%20recent%20national%20polls%20as%20of%20late%20April%20in%20each%20election%20year%20going%20back%20to%201972%20%28for%20the%201980%20election%20and%20before%2C%20fewer%20than%2010%20general%20election%20polls%20conducted%20in%20the%20first%20four%20months%20of%20the%20year%20were%20available%29)\\]. This suggests that while being ahead in the polls three months before the election can be an indicator of potential success, it is far from a guarantee.\n\nAdditionally, the reliability of early general election presidential trial heat polls has been questioned. Pew Research notes that early polls have a poor track record, with the political climate often changing significantly between the early polling period and the actual election \\[[6](https://www.pewresearch.org/2007/02/14/how-reliable-are-the-early-presidential-polls/#:~:text=One%20decided%20against%20a%20run%20%28New%20York%20Gov)\\]. This further underscores the uncertainty and potential for change in voter preferences as the election date approaches.\n\nIn summary, while leading in national polls three months before the election can provide some insight, historical data indicates that it is not a highly reliable predictor of the eventual election outcome.\n## Q6: How often does a candidate with strong intra-party support win the general election?\nAnswer:\nIn the context of the larger question \"Will Donald Trump win the US 2024 Election?\", it is important to consider the historical correlation between a candidate's intra-party support and their success in the general election. While the provided sources primarily focus on the correlation between a President's approval rating and their party's performance in midterm elections, they do offer some insights that can be extrapolated to general elections.\n\nHistorically, a President's approval rating has been a significant predictor of their party's performance in midterm elections. For instance, a study found a statistically significant linear model where the President's approval rating (x) correlated with the number of Congressional seats won or lost by the President's party (y) during midterm elections: \\( y = -107.423 + 1.594x \\) \\[[5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07545.pdf#:~:text=An%20analysis%20of%20the%20data%20yielded%20the%20statistically%20significant%20linear%20model%20y%20%3D%20-107)\\]. This model was more accurate for approval ratings above 50%, suggesting that higher approval ratings within the party can lead to better electoral outcomes. However, this correlation is moderate (correlation coefficient of 0.517) and primarily applies to midterm elections, not general elections \\[[13](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.07545.pdf#:~:text=The%20seat%20gain%20is%20centered%20at%20-25%20seats%2C%20meaning%20that%20on%20average%20the%20President%27s%20party%20loses%20seats%20during%20Midterms)\\].\n\nWhile this data does not directly answer the question about general elections, it implies that strong intra-party support, as reflected in high approval ratings, can positively influence electoral outcomes. However, it is crucial to consider other factors such as the broader political climate, the candidate's appeal to independent and swing voters, and the overall campaign strategy.\n\nIn summary, while strong intra-party support is beneficial and correlates with better performance in midterm elections, its impact on general election outcomes is less direct and should be considered alongside other variables.\n## Q7: What is the historical impact of key endorsements on a candidate\u2019s chances of winning the US Presidential Election?\nAnswer:\nThe historical impact of key endorsements on a candidate\u2019s chances of winning the US Presidential Election is generally limited, though there are notable exceptions. For instance, Oprah Winfrey's endorsement of Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic Primary had a measurable impact, with 23% of Democrats indicating they were more likely to vote for Obama due to her endorsement \\[[1](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/celebrityendorsements_garthwaitemoore.pdf#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Pew%20Research%20Center%2C%2023%20percent%20of%20Democrats%20said%20that%20Winfrey%27s%20endorsement%20would%20make%20them%20more%20likely%20to%20vote%20for%20Obama%20%28Pew%20Research%20Center%2C%202007%20%29)\\]. This case is exceptional due to Winfrey's unique influence and the geographically varying indicators of her popularity, which were unrelated to political factors \\[[1](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/stuff_for_blog/celebrityendorsements_garthwaitemoore.pdf#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Pew%20Research%20Center%2C%2023%20percent%20of%20Democrats%20said%20that%20Winfrey%27s%20endorsement%20would%20make%20them%20more%20likely%20to%20vote%20for%20Obama%20%28Pew%20Research%20Center%2C%202007%20%29)\\].\n\nHowever, most endorsements do not significantly alter election outcomes. Research indicates that endorsements often reflect the pre-existing attributes of a candidate, such as incumbency, party affiliation, and political savvy, rather than independently boosting their chances \\[[2](https://theconversation.com/trump-endorsed-candidates-would-generally-win-even-without-his-support-and-thats-usually-the-case-with-all-political-endorsements-184231#:~:text=But%20in%20most%20cases%2C%20their%20effects%20are%20far%20less%20potent%20than%20commentators%20might%20expect)\\]\\[[3](https://theconversation.com/trump-endorsed-candidates-would-generally-win-even-without-his-support-and-thats-usually-the-case-with-all-political-endorsements-184231#:~:text=Political%20science%20says%20that%20endorsements%20do%20occasionally%20matter%20for%20determining%20election%20outcomes)\\]. For example, the so-called \"Trump bump\" is largely a reflection of the candidate's existing strengths rather than the endorsement itself \\[[2](https://theconversation.com/trump-endorsed-candidates-would-generally-win-even-without-his-support-and-thats-usually-the-case-with-all-political-endorsements-184231#:~:text=But%20in%20most%20cases%2C%20their%20effects%20are%20far%20less%20potent%20than%20commentators%20might%20expect)\\]. Additionally, a survey of 804 likely Ohio voters during the 2016 presidential campaign found that the majority reported endorsements had no effect on their voting choice, although a substantial minority did report increased or decreased likelihood of support due to endorsements \\[[7](https://www.cleveland.com/opinion/2016/02/presidential_endorsements_incl.html#:~:text=We%20surveyed%20804%20likely%20Ohio%20general%20election%20voters%20to%20gauge%20the%20electoral%20effects%20of%20various%20traditional%20and%20celebrity%20endorsements)\\].\n\nIn summary, while specific high-profile endorsements like Oprah's can have a significant impact, most endorsements generally have a limited effect on changing voter behavior and election outcomes.\n\n# S3: FORECASTS\n*Median prediction*: 66.0%\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 0\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- In the past 100 years, 14 out of 19 U.S. presidents who sought re-election were successful, giving a re-election success rate of approximately 74% [Q0.Q0]\n- Less than half of all U.S. presidents who have served have been re-elected to a second term in office, with 21 presidents winning a second term [Q0.Q0]\n- The leader in national polls three months before the election has won the election only half the time in the past ten presidential campaigns [Q5.Q5]\n- Polling data has had a mixed record in predicting the winner of the US Presidential Election over the last 50 years, with an accuracy closer to 60% [Q2.Q2]\n- 39% of Metaculus questions resolved positively in 2018 [Q0.Q0]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.74\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: The most appropriate base rate is 74% because it is based on historical data of U.S. presidents who sought re-election, which is highly relevant to Donald Trump's situation as a former president seeking re-election.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Donald Trump is leading in 5 of the 7 battleground states that are most likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential Election [Q0.Q0]\n- Trump retains the support of 90% of those who voted for him in 2020 [Q0.Q0]\n- Trump's campaign has managed to raise significant funds, reportedly pulling in $7.1 million since his mug shot was taken in Atlanta, and nearly $20 million over three weeks following his indictments and arraignment [Q1.Q1]\n- LaRouchePAC has officially endorsed Donald Trump for the 2024 Presidential Election [Q6.Q6]\n- A significant majority of Republican primary voters believe that Trump is the best candidate to beat Joe Biden in the 2024 election [Q6.Q6]\n\n*Cons*: \n- Trump faces multiple legal challenges, including a ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court that he engaged in insurrection, making him ineligible to hold the office of President, pending review by the United States Supreme Court [Q7.Q7]\n- Trump is under investigation by Atlanta-area prosecutor Fani Willis for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia, with potential charges looming [Q7.Q7]\n- Trump's campaign activity appears to be less visible compared to previous election cycles [Q1.Q1]\n- Skipping debates may have hurt Trump's standing in the polls [Q1.Q1]\n- Polling and betting markets indicate that Trump is trailing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by a significant margin [Q3.Q3]\n\n*Reasoning*: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 74%.

The close polling averages in battleground states and potential impact of skipping debates further warrant a slight adjustment down by 2% to 67%.\n\n*Prediction*: 67.0%\n\n\n\n## Reasoning from forecaster 4\n*Possible Base Rates*:\n- In the past 100 years, 14 out of 19 U.S. presidents who sought re-election were successful, giving a re-election success rate of approximately 74% [Q0.Q0]\n- Less than half of all U.S. presidents who have served have been re-elected to a second term in office, with 21 presidents winning a second term [Q0.Q0]\n- The accuracy of battleground state polls in predicting the winner of the U.S. presidential election has varied, with significant underestimation in some cases [Q1.Q1]\n- Polling data has had a mixed record in predicting the winner of the US Presidential Election over the last 50 years [Q2.Q2]\n- There are no historical precedents of a major party candidate with significant legal troubles winning the US Presidential Election [Q3.Q3]\n- Having a robust fundraising lead is generally a strong predictor of success in U.S. Presidential Elections [Q4.Q4]\n- The leader in national polls at the end of April has won the election only half the time in the past ten presidential campaigns [Q5.Q5]\n- Strong intra-party support correlates with better performance in midterm elections, but its impact on general election outcomes is less direct [Q6.Q6]\n- Most endorsements generally have a limited effect on changing voter behavior and election outcomes [Q7.Q7]\n\n*Chosen Base Rate*: 0.74\n\n*Chosen Base Rate Explanation*: Given the possible base rates, the most appropriate base rate is 74% because it directly pertains to the re-election success rate of U.S. presidents, which is the closest historical analogy to Trump's situation as a former president seeking re-election.\n\n*Pros*:\n- Donald Trump is leading in 5 of the 7 battleground states that are most likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 US Presidential Election [Q0.Q0]\n- Trump retains the support of 90% of those who voted for him in 2020 [Q0.Q0]\n- Trump's campaign has managed to raise significant funds, pulling in $7.1 million since his mug shot was taken in Atlanta, and nearly $20 million over three weeks following his indictments and arraignment [Q1.Q1]\n- A significant majority of Republican primary voters believe that Trump is the best candidate to beat Joe Biden in the 2024 election [Q6.Q6]\n\n*Cons*: \n- Trump faces multiple legal challenges, including a ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court that he engaged in insurrection, making him ineligible to hold the office of President, pending review by the United States Supreme Court [Q7.Q7]\n- Trump's campaign activity appears to be less visible compared to previous election cycles [Q1.Q1]\n- Skipping debates may have hurt Trump's standing in the polls [Q1.Q1]\n- Among those who did not vote in 2020, Harris leads Trump by nine points (38% to 29%) [Q0.Q0]\n- Trump is trailing Florida Governor Ron DeSantis by a significant margin on prediction markets, including PredictIt [Q3.Q3]\n\n*Reasoning*: I'll start with the chosen base rate of 74%. Trump's strong fundraising and support in battleground states are positive indicators, so I'll adjust up by 5% to 79%. However, his multiple legal challenges and less visible campaign activity are significant negatives, so I'll adjust down by 10% to 69%. The fact that Trump is trailing in prediction markets and has skipped debates, which may hurt his standing, warrants a further adjustment down by 5% to 64%. Finally, while he retains strong intra-party support, the mixed historical accuracy of polls and endorsements suggests caution, so I'll make a small upward adjustment of 2% to 66%.\n\n*Prediction*: 66.0%\n\n\n\n",
