- `asyncio_mode = auto` is set in pytest.ini so when making tests don't mark tests with pytest.mark.asyncio
- all functions should have type hints for parameters and outputs. For built in type hints (like `list`, `dict`, `tuple`) don't import the typing library, just use the more modern type hints built into Python.
